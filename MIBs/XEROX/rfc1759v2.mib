--  Module: Compilable IETF Printer MIB v2 - XCMI Version 5.01
--  Editor: Ira McDonald
--  File:   printer.mv1 (SMIv1 version)
--  Date:   28 November 2001

--
--  Change Log for this corrected compilable version
--
--  - Commented out (removed) NOTIFICATION-GROUP from IMPORTS clause,
--    GROUP 'prtAlertTrapGroup' from MODULE-COMPLIANCE macro, and
--    NOTIFICATION-GROUP 'prtAlertTrapGroup' from end-of-file
--    (for compatibility with older SMIv2 compilers)
--  - Changed LAST-UPDATED and REVISIONS clauses in MODULE-COMPLIANCE
--    macro to use 2-digit years instead of 4-digit years
--    (for compatibility with many compilers)
--  - Changed SYNTAX of 'prtInputDefaultIndex' to
--    'Integer32 (1..65535)' from 'Integer (-1..65535)'
--    (per IESG comments and for RFC 1759 compatibility)
--  - Changed SYNTAX of 'prtOutputDefaultIndex' to
--    'Integer32 (1..65535)' from 'Integer (-1..65535)'
--    (per IESG comments and for RFC 1759 compatibility)
--  - Changed SYNTAX of 'prtAlertIndex' to
--    'Integer32 (1..2147483647)' from 'Integer (1..65535)'
--    (per IESG comments and for RFC 1759 compatibility)
--  - Changed MAX-ACCESS of 'prtAlertIndex' to 'read-only'
--    from 'not-accessible' for later 'printerV2Alert' trap
--    (to correct compiler error)
--  - Added 'prtAlertIndex' to 'prtAlertTableV2Group'
--    (to correct compiler warning)

--      These values are to be used to identify the encoding employed
--      for strings in the MIB where this is not fixed by the MIB.
--
--      Some objects that allow a choice of coded character set are: the
--      prtLocalizationCharacterSet object in the LocalizationTable and
--      prtInterpreterDefaultCharSetIn. The

--      set) of the 'description' objects and the console, respectively.
--
--      The current list of character sets and their enumerated values
--      used to reference them are contained in the IANA Character Set
--      registry.  The enum value is indicated by the MIBenum entry in
--      the registry.  The enum symbol is indicated by the Alias that
--      starts with 'cs' for character set.
--
--      The IANA character sets registry is [4].  To add a new character
--      set to the IANA Registry, see RFC 2278 or BCP 19 [20].

--  DESCRIPTION
--      "The level of training required to handle this alert, if human
--
--
--      intervention is required. The noInterventionRequired value
--      should be used if the event does not require any human
--      intervention. The training level is an enumeration that is
--      determined and assigned by the printer manufacturer based on the
--      information or the training required to handle this alert.  The
--      printer will break alerts into these different training levels.
--      It is the responsibility of the management application in the
--      system to determine how a particular alert is handled and how
--      and to whom that alert is routed.  The following are the four
--      training levels of alerts:
--
--      Field Service - Alerts that typically require advanced
--          training and technical knowledge of the printer and its sub
--          units. An example of a technical person would be a
--          manufacturer's Field Service representative, or other person
--          formally trained by the manufacturer or similar
--          representative.
--      Trained - Alerts that require an intermediate or moderate level
--          of knowledge of the printer and its sub-units. A typical
--          examples of alerts that a trained operator can handle is
--          replacing toner cartridges.
--      Untrained -     Alerts that can be fixed without prior
--          training either because the action to correct the alert is
--          obvious or the printer can help the untrained person fix the
--          problem. A typical example of such an alert is reloading
--          paper trays and emptying output bins on a low end printer.
--      Management -    Alerts that have to do with overall operation of
--          and configuration of the printer. Examples of management
--          events are configuration change of sub-units."

--  STATUS    current
--  DESCRIPTION
--      "The code that describes the type of alert for this entry in the
--
--
--      table. Binary change event alerts describe states of the subunit
--      while unary change event alerts describe a single event. The
--      same alert code can be used for a binary change event or a unary
--      change event, depending on implementation. Also, the same alert
--      code can be used to indicate a critical or a non-critical
--      (warning) alert, depending on implementation. The value of
--      prtAlertSeverityLevel specifies binary vs. unary and critical
--      vs. non-critical for each event for the implementation.
--
--      While there are some specific codes for many subunits, the
--      generic codes should be used for most subunit alerts. The
--      network management station can then query the subunit specified
--      by prtAlertGroup to determine further subunit status and other
--      subunit information.
--
--      An agent shall not add two entries to the alert table for the
--      same event, one containing a generic event code and the other
--      containing a specific event code/ the agent shall add only one
--      entry in the alert table for each event/ either generic
--      (preferred) or specific, not both.
--
--      Implementation of the unary change event
--      alertRemovalOfBinaryChangeEntry(1801) is optional. When
--      implemented, this alert code shall indicate to network
--      management stations that the trailing edge of a binary change
--      event has occurred and the corresponding alert entry has been
--      removed from the alert table. As with all events, the
--      alertRemovalOfBinaryChangeEntry(1801) alert shall be placed at
--      the end of the alert table. Such an alert table entry shall
--      specify the following information:
--
--      prtAlertSeverityLevel    warningUnaryChangeEvent(4)
--      prtAlertTrainingLevel    noInterventionRequired(7)
--      prtAlertGroup            alert(18)

--                               change event that this event

--                               alert table.
--
--
--      Optionally, the agent may generate a trap coincident with
--      removing the binary change event and placing the unary change
--      event alertRemovalOfBinaryChangeEntry(1801) in the alert table.
--      For such a trap, the prtAlertIndex sent with the above trap
--      parameters shall be the index of the

    DESCRIPTION


        "Counts configuration changes within the printer. A
        configuration change is defined to be an action that results in
        a change to any MIB object other than those that reflect status
        or level, or those that act as counters or gauges. In addition,
        any action that results in a row being added or deleted from any
        table in the Printer MIB is considered a configuration change.
        Such changes will often affect the capability of the printer to
        service certain types of print jobs. Management applications may
        cache infrequently changed configuration information about sub
        units within the printer. This object should be incremented
        whenever the agent wishes to notify management applications that
        any cached configuration information for this device is to be
        considered 'stale'. At this point, the management application
        should flush any configuration information cached about this
        device and fetch new configuration information.

        The following are examples of actions that would cause the
        prtGeneralConfigChanges object to be incremented:

        - Adding an output bin
        - Changing the media in a sensing input tray
        - Changing the value of prtInputMediaType

        Note that the prtGeneralConfigChanges counter would not be
        incremented when an input tray is temporarily removed to load
        additional paper or when the level of an input device changes."

-- The Print Job Delivery Channel Group
--
-- Print Job Delivery Channels are independent sources of print
-- data. Here, print data is the term used for the information
-- that is used to construct printed pages and may have both data
-- and control aspects. The output of a channel is in a form
-- suitable for input to one of the interpreters as a
-- stream. A channel may be independently enabled (allowing
-- print data to flow) or disabled (stopping the flow of
-- print data). A printer may have one or more channels.
--
-- The Print Job Delivery Channel table describes the
-- capabilities of the printer and not what is currently being
-- performed by the printer
--
-- Basically, the print job delivery channel abstraction
-- describes the final processing step of getting the print data
-- to an interpreter. It might include some level of
-- decompression or decoding of print stream data.
-- channel. All of these aspects are hidden in the channel
-- abstraction.
--
-- There are many kinds of print job delivery channels/ some of
-- which are based on networks and others which are not. For
-- example, a channel can be a serial (or parallel) connection/
-- it can be a service, such as the UNIX Line Printer Daemon
-- (LPD), offering services over a network connection/ or
-- it could be a disk drive into which a floppy disk with
-- the print data is inserted. Each print job delivery channel is
-- identified by the electronic path and/or service protocol
-- used to deliver print data to a print data interpreter.
--
-- Channel example                   Implementation
--
-- serial port channel            bi-directional data channel
-- parallel port channel          often uni-directional channel
-- IEEE 1284 port channel         bi-directional channel
-- SCSI port channel              bi-directional
-- Apple PAP channel              may be based on LocalTalk,
--                                Ethernet or Tokentalk
-- LPD Server channel             TCP/IP based, port 515


-- Netware Remote Printer         SPX/IPX based channel
-- Netware Print Server           SPX/IPX based channel
--
-- It is easy to note that this is a mixed bag.  There are
-- some physical connections over which no (or very meager)
-- protocols are run (e.g. the serial or old parallel ports)
-- and there are services which often have elaborate
-- protocols that run over a number of protocol stacks. In
-- the end, what is important is the delivery of print data
-- through the channel.
--
-- The print job delivery channel sub-units are represented by
-- the Print Job Delivery Channel Group in the Model. It has a
-- current print job control language, which can be used to
-- specify which interpreter is to be used for the print data and
-- to query and change environment variables used by the
-- interpreters (and Management Applications). There is also a
-- default interpreter that is to be used if an interpreter is
-- not explicitly specified using the Control Language.

-- The first seven items in the Print Job Delivery Channel Table
-- define the "channel" itself.  A channel typically depends on
-- other protocols and interfaces to provide the data that flows
-- through the channel.
--
-- Control of a print job delivery channel is largely limited to
-- enabling or disabling the entire channel itself. It is likely
-- that more control of the process of accessing print data
-- will be needed over time. Thus, the ChannelType will
-- allow type-specific data to be associated with each
-- channel (using ChannelType specific groups in a fashion
-- analogous to the media specific MIBs that are associated
-- with the IANAIfType in the Interfaces Table). As a first
-- step in this direction, each channel will identify the
-- underlying Interface on which it is based. This is the
-- eighth object in each row of the table.

    DESCRIPTION
        "Auxiliary information to allow a printing application to use
        the channel for data submission to the printer.  An application
        capable of using a specific PrtChannelType should be able to use
        the combined information from the prtChannelInformation and
        other channel and interface group objects to 'bootstrap' its use
        of the channel.  prtChannelInformation is not intended to


        provide a general channel description, nor to provide
        information that is available once the channel is in use.

        The encoding and interpretation of the prtChannelInformation
        object is specific to channel type.  The description of each
        PrtChannelType enum value for which prtChannelInformation is
        defined specifies the appropriate encoding and interpretation,
        including interaction with other objects.  For channel types
        that do not specify a prtChannelInformation value, its value
        shall be null (0 length).

        When a new PrtChannelType enumeration value is registered, its
        accompanying description must specify the encoding and
        interpretation of the prtChannelInformation value for the
        channel type.  prtChannelInformation semantics for an existing
        PrtChannelType may be added or amended in the same manner as
        described in section 2.4.1 for type 2 enumeration values.

        The prtChannelInformation specifies values for a collection of
        channel attributes, represented as text according to the
        following rules:

        1. The prtChannelInformation is not affected by localization.

        2. The prtChannelInformation is a list of entries representing
        the attribute values.  Each entry consists of the following
        items, in order:

        a. A keyword, composed of alphabetic characters (A-Z, a-z)
        represented by their NVT ASCII [10] codes, that
        identifies a channel attribute,

        b. The NVT ASCII code for an Equals Sign (=) (code 61) to
        delimit the keyword,

        c. A data value encoded using rules specific to the
        PrtChannelType to with the prtChannelInformation applies which
        must in no case allow an octet with value 10 (the NVT ASCII Line
        Feed code),

        d. the NVT ASCII code for a Line Feed character (code 10) to
        delimit the data value.

        No other octets shall be present.


        Keywords are case-sensitive.  Conventionally, keywords are
        capitalized (including each word of a multi-word keyword) and
        since they occupy space in the prtChannelInformation, they are
        kept short.

        3. If a channel attribute has multiple values, it is represented
        by multiple entries with the same keyword, each specifying one
        value. Otherwise, there shall be at most one entry for each
        attribute.

        4. By default, entries may appear in any order.  If there are
        ordering constraints for particular entries, these must be
        specified in their definitions.

        5. The prtChannelInformation value by default consists of text
        represented by NVT ASCII graphics character codes. However,
        other representations may be specified:

        a. In cases where the prtChannelInformation value contains
        information not normally coded in textual form, whatever
        symbolic representation is conventionally used for the
        information should be used for encoding the
        prtChannelInformation value. (For instance, a binary port value
        might be represented as a decimal number using NVT ASCII codes.)
        Such encoding must be specified in the definition of the value.

        b. The value may contain textual information in a character set
        other than NVT ASCII graphics characters.  (For instance, an
        identifier might consist of ISO 10646 text encoded using the
        UTF-8 encoding scheme.) Such a character set and its encoding
        must be specified in the definition of the value.

        6. For each PrtChannelType for which prtChannelInformation
        entries are defined, the descriptive text associated with the
        PrtChannelType enumeration value shall specify the following
        information for each entry:

        Title:        Brief description phrase, e.g.: 'Port name',
                      'Service Name', etc.

        Keyword:      The keyword value, e.g.: 'Port' or 'Service'

        Syntax:       The encoding of the entry value if it cannot be
                      directly represented by NVT ASCII.


        Status:       'Mandatory', 'Optional', or 'Conditionally
                      Mandatory'

        Multiplicity: 'Single' or 'Multiple' to indicate whether the
                      entry may be present multiple times.

        Description:  Description of the use of the entry, other
                      information required to complete the definition
                      (e.g.: ordering constraints, interactions between
                      entries).

        Applications that interpret prtChannelInformation should ignore
        unrecognized entries, so they are not affected if new entry
        types are added."

        initialized to 1 when the printer is reset. (i.e. The first
        event placed in the alert table after a reset of the printer
        shall have an index value of 1.)  When the printer adds an alert
        to the table, that alert is assigned the next higher integer
        value from the last item entered into the table.  If the index
        value reaches its maximum value, the next index value used must
        be 1.

        NOTE: The management application will read the alert table when
        a trap or event notification occurs or at a periodic rate and
        then parse the table to determine if any new entries were added
        by comparing the last known index value with the current highest
        index value. The management application will then update its
        copy of the alert table.  When the printer discovers that an
        alert is no longer active, the printer shall remove the row for
        that alert from the table and shall reduce the number of rows in
        the table.  The printer may add or delete any number of rows
        from the table at any time.  The management station can detect
        when binary change alerts have been deleted by requesting an

        retrieval is not possible.  The objects 'prtAlertCriticalEvents'
