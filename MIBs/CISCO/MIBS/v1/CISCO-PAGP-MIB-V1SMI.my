--    The MIB module for configuration of Fast Etherchannel
--    and the operation of the Port Aggregation Protocol (PAgP).
--    These features allow two or more physical interfaces to
--    be aggregated together to form a single agport.  This
--    agport behaves like a single interface with improved
--    bandwidth and/or availability over each of its component
--    physical interfaces.
--    
--    You can monitor interfaces, agports, and related statistics
--    through the ifStackTable and ifTable entries.

PagpGroupCapability ::= INTEGER
-- TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
--  Status
--    mandatory
--  Descr
--    The group-capability value of an interface.  Indicates the
--    ability of the interface to aggregate together with other
--    interfaces to form aggregate links, or agports.
--    
--    The value of PagpGroupCapability has no meaning except by
--    comparison (equal or not equal) to other PagpGroupCapability
--    values for different interfaces (ifIndex values) having the
--    same device (pagpDeviceId).  If two different interfaces on the
--    same device have the same PagpGroupCapability, then they are
--    capable of being aggregated into the same agport.  If they
--    have different PagpGroupCapability values, then they cannot
--    be aggregated together.
--    
--    The assignment of PagpGroupCapability values to the variables
--    which use them can be made either by the network administrator
--    or by the managed system, depending on the variable.  One
--    easily-used and understood means of assigning
--    PagpGroupCapability values is to use, for each interface's
--    PagpGroupCapability, the lowest ifIndex (in numerical value)
--    of all of the intefaces with which this interface can
--    aggregate.  The use of this technique is not required.
--    Therefore, when examining a variable using the
--    PagpGroupCapability, the user must not assume that the values
--    have any meaning, other than by comparison for equality with
--    other interfaces' values on the same device.
--    
--    Note also that a single managed system may utilize multiple
--    pagpDeviceId values.  PagpGroupCapability values may be
--    compared only among those interfaces with the same
--    pagpDeviceId values.

--    Etherchannel on this interface:
--    
--        off(1)       No aggregation of interfaces is allowed.
--    
--        manual(2)    Aggregation is under control of the
--                     pagpGroupCapabilityConfiguration
--                     section; no PAgP protocol packets are sent,
--                     and any received are ignored.
--    
--        pagpOn(3)    Aggregation is under control of the PAgP
--                     protocol.  PAgP packets are sent on the
--                     interface and those received are acted upon.
--    
--    It is anticipated that further values of this textual convention
--    may be defined as additional aggregation protocols are defined.

PagpPortPriority ::= INTEGER(0..255)
-- TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
--  Status

        }
-- TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
--  Status
--    mandatory
--  Descr
--    The group-capability configuration operation mode of the PAgP
--    protocol on this interface:
--    
--        desirable(1) aggregation is under control of the PAgP
--                     protocol.  PAgP packets are sent on the
--                     interface and those received are acted upon.
--                     If no data packets are received on the
--                     interface, then the interface is never attached
--                     to an agport and cannot be used for data.
--    
--        desirableSilent(2)
--                     aggregation is under control of the PAgP
--                     protocol.  PAgP packets are sent on the
--                     interface and those received are acted upon.
--                     If no data packets are received on the
--                     interface, then after some timeout period, the
--                     interface is attached, by itself, to an agport
--                     and can thus be used for data transmission.
--    
--        automatic(3) aggregation is under control of the PAgP
--                     protocol.  PAgP packets are not sent on the
--                     interface until at least one PAgP packet is
--                     received which indicates that the sender is
--                     operating in desirable or desirableSilent mode.
--                     If no data packets are received on the
--                     interface, then the interface is never attached
--                     to an agport and cannot be used for data.
--    
--        automaticSilent(4)
--                     aggregation is under control of the PAgP
--                     protocol.  PAgP packets are not sent on the
--                     interface until at least one PAgP packet is
--                     received which indicates that the sender is
--                     operating in desirable or desirableSilent mode.
--                     If no data packets are received on the

--                     interface is attached, by itself, to an agport
--                     and can thus be used for data transmission.
--    
--        The value of PagpOperationMode takes effect only when the
--        value of pagpEthcOperationMode is pagpOn(3).  If
--        pagpEthcOperationMode has any other value, the operation of
--        the PAgP protocol is disabled.

pagpOperGroupCapability OBJECT-TYPE

    DESCRIPTION
        "This variable informs the system administrator examining the
        Fast
        Etherchannel MIB of the capabilities of the current state of the
        interface's hardware to form agports.
        
        The pagpOperGroupCapability values are adjusted automatically by
        the managed system to reflect configuration changes, such as
        port
        speed or duplex mode, which can affect the ability of an
        interface
        to join agports.
        
        pagpOperGroupCapability reflects the ability to form
        aggregations; it does not specify whether the interface is
        or is not currently a member of such an aggregation.
        
        pagpOperGroupCapability values are chosen so that no two
        interfaces
        may be aggregated unless both pagpPhysGroupCapability and
        pagpAdminGroupCapability permit the aggregation, as well as the
        current configuration of the interfaces. 
        pagpOperGroupCapability
        may change dynamically, as a result of the operation of
        automatic
        configuration protocols such as PAgP, in order to prevent
        illegal
        aggregations.
        
        When the PAgP protocol is enabled, then pagpOperGroupCapability
        is the value of the group capability being transmitted on this
        interface in PAgP packets."

pagpAdminGroupCapability OBJECT-TYPE
    SYNTAX PagpGroupCapability
--    Rsyntax INTEGER
    ACCESS read-write
    STATUS mandatory
    DESCRIPTION
        "pagpAdminGroupCapability is used by the network administrator
        to
        control the aggregation of interfaces into agports.  The default
        value of pagpAdminGroupCapability is equal to the value of
        pagpPhysGroupCapability on that same interface.
        
        A pagpAdminGroupCapability may be set to restrict which
        interfaces
        may be aggregated.  Any attempt to set an
        pagpAdminGroupCapability value that permits two interfaces to
        be aggregated together that are prohibited from being aggregated
        by the pagpPhysGroupCapability values will be refused.
        
        A given device may place consistency requirements on
        pagpAdminGroupCapability values that span multiple interfaces.
        For example, one may be changing interfaces 1-4 from group
        capabilities 1, 1, 1, 1 to group capabilities 1, 1, 3, 3.  The
        capability vector 1, 1, 3, 1 may be illegal.  The managed device
        will refuse a request to set a value in an interface's
        pagpAdminGroupCapability variable if: 1) that new value would
        result in an illegal combination of values; and 2) the interface
        being set does not have its pagpEthcOperationMode variable set
        to
        off(1).
        
        The pagpEthcOperationMode variable may be used to avoid illegal
        combinations of pagpAdminGroupCapability values.  As long as a
        given interface's pagpEthcOperationMode is in the off state, any
        value may be set in that interface's pagpAdminGroupCapability
        variable.  In the above example, the third interface could be
        disabled, the 3 could be written to the third and fourth
        interfaces, and the third interfaces re-enabled.
        
        The operating manuals of the managed device must be consulted to
        determine the legality of a given combination of
        pagpAdminGroupCapability values."
