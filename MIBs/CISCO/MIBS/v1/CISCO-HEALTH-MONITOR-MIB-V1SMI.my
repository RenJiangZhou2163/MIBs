--    Health Monitor MIB module. 
--    
--    The Health Monitor uses a model based on events of varying  
--    severity and frequency, and predefined rules, to generate  
--    a metric that represents a system's (and its subsystems')  
--    level of health.    
--    
--    The events are typically internally generated notifications 
--    in response to detrimental or correctional changes in the  
--    state of the hardware or software of the system. Detrimental 
--    events are classified under one of the following severity  
--    levels: 
--    
--    Catastrophic   - Causes or leads to system failure 
--    Critical       - Major subsystem or functionality failure 
--    High           - Potential for major impact to important  
--                     functions 
--    Medium         - Potential for minor impact to functionality 
--    Low            - Negligible impact to functionality 
--    
--    Whilst correctional events fall under the following  
--    classification: 
--    
--    Positive       - Not a fault event. May cause or lead to  
--                     the return of functionality 
--    
--    This MIB module provides information for tracking occurrences 
--    of the above events, and presents the associated health  
--    metric for the system and its component subsystems.

        subsystems. 
        
        The Health Monitor statistics present in each row provide

        statistics apply.

        cards then, in the context of this MIB, these are also  
        defined to be in the same system. If these entities also  
        run an instance of the Health Monitor then the summary  
        information from the distributed Health Monitors is
