--  Descr
--    The MIB module for management of IP Multicast routing,
--    but independent of the specific multicast routing protocol
--    in use.
--  RevDate
--    200503070000Z
--  RevDescr
--    Add 32-bit and 64-bit per interface packet counters.
--    These apply to all interfaces, including Point-To-Point
--    types, unlike ifInMulticastPkts etc which only apply to
--    interfaces with multicast at that layer. Also fix import
--    of Unsigned32.
--  RevDate
--    200012220000Z
--  RevDescr
--    Add ciscoIpMRouteNumberOfEntries. Also add 64-bit
--    counters to represent information for high speed
--    interfaces like OC-192. Deprecate ciscoIpMRouteBps in
--    favour of the 64-bit counter ciscoIpMRouteBps2. 
--    ciscoIpMouteMetric deprecated in favour of
--    ciscoIpMouteMetric2 to correctly represent a 32-bit
--    unsigned metric value.
--  RevDate
--    200005150000Z
--  RevDescr
--    Added MIB support for multicast heartbeat monitoring.
--  RevDate
--    9902080000Z
--  RevDescr
--    Add ciscoIpMRouteJoinFlag, ciscoIpMRouteMsdpFlag and
--    ciscoIpMRouteProxyJoinFlag.
--  RevDate
--    9610110000Z
--  RevDescr
--    Obsolete ciscoIpMRouteInLimit and replaced with
--    ciscoIpMRouteInLimit2.
