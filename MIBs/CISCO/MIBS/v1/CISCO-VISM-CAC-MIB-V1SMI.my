vismChanCacTable OBJECT-TYPE
    SYNTAX SEQUENCE OF VismChanCacEntry
    ACCESS not-accessible
    STATUS mandatory
    DESCRIPTION
        "This table defines the CAC success or failure statistics.  
         CAC functionality is applied on a per PVC(Permanent virtual 
         circuit) basis for accepting the new calls in a switching 
         model (i.e when CRCX(CreateConnection) message is received 
         from the call agent) and when adding a new binding between a  
         CID(Channel Identifier) and a PVC in the AAL2 trunking  
         application ('addcid' command). In both switching and trunking 
         models, the CAC functionality is applied for upspeeding the 
         connections due to the detection of fax/modem tone on a  
         connection configured with voice compression. The entries in  
         this table are implicitly created and deleted with the  
         creation and deletion of entries in vismChanCnfGrpEntry 
         (defined in CISCO-VISM-CONN-MIB MIB). "

    ACCESS not-accessible
    STATUS mandatory
    DESCRIPTION
        "Each entry in this table corresponds to a PVC, since 
         the CAC functionality is applied on a per PVC basis. The 
         bandwidth is allocated on a per PVC basis and the  
         connection admission control is done by comparing the  
         available bandwidth on a PVC with the required bandwidth 
         as a result of new connection setup request or upspeed 
         request. "

        "This attribute defines whether the PVC is the master end 
         or slave end. CAC functionality is applied only at the master 
        end of the PVC. It is not necessary if the PVC end is configured 
        as the slave end. This is to prevent the glare condition  
         resulting from the simultaneous allocation of the same

    DESCRIPTION
        "This attribute defines the count of connections that 
         passed successfully the CAC function. CAC functionality is 
         applied either due to 
         1) The CRCX message sent to VISM from the Call Agent to set 
         up a new connection OR at the time of 'addcid' command in 
         AAL2 trunking application.

    DESCRIPTION
        "This attribute defines the count of connections that

         for upspeed. 
         'maintain' - to maintain the connection with the prior 
         compression scheme.

         of this object will be used.  
        
         Note that the default value of maintaining the prior  
         encoding scheme is applicable in the trunking application 
         only since the connection is not deleted after the fax/modem 
         switchover.In the case of switching application, the 
         connection is deleted after the fax/modem switchover.
