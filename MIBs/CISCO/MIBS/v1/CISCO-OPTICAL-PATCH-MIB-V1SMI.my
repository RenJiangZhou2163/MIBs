--    This MIB module is used to configure and monitor the network
--    element view of optical patches between two ports or 
--    fibers on the same network element.
--    
--    It is up to the user to keep the provisioned information that
--    is reflected in this MIB module in sync with the actual patches
--    present between ports or fibers on the network element.
--    Provisioning of a patch does not cause a patch to be inserted;
--    it only informs the network element that a patch has been, or
--    is soon to be, added or removed.
--  RevDate
--    200203180000Z
--  RevDescr
--    This revision adds support for patching one interface to two
--     different interfaces in the receive and transmit directions.
--    
--     This revision deprecates the cOPatchInterfaceTable and 
--     replaces it with the new cOPatchIntfTable. This new table
--     includes the cOPatchIntfDirection object along with ifIndex
--     as part of the table index. The cOPatchIntfDirection object
--     identifies whether this interface is patched to another
--     interface within a network element in the receive, transmit
--     or both directions.
--    
--     A new object cOPatchDirOnLowIf is added to the cOPatchTable
--     in order to identify the patch direction relative to the
--     interface with low ifIndex.

        has been, or is soon to be, added or removed.
        
        Each entry in the table models a unidirectional or
        bidirectional patch between two interfaces on the same
        network element. When one interface is patched to two

        appear in two different entries in the table.
        
        The terms low and high are chosen to represent numerical
        ordering of the two interfaces associated with a patch.  That
        is, the interface with the lower value of ifIndex is termed
        'low', while the other interface associated with the patch is

        Prior to creating an entry in the table, the manager should
        obtain a unique value of cOPatchIndex by reading the
