DataCollectionSubtree ::= OBJECT IDENTIFIER
-- TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
--  Status
--    mandatory
--  Descr
--    The subtree component of a (subtree, list) tuple.  Such a
--    (subtree, list) tuple defines a set of objects and their
--    values to be collected as accounting data for a connection.
--    The subtree specifies a single OBJECT IDENTIFIER value such
--    that each object in the set is named by the subtree value
--    appended with a single additional sub-identifier.

DataCollectionList ::= OCTET STRING(SIZE(0..8))
-- TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
--  Status
--    mandatory
--  Descr
--    The list component of a (subtree, list) tuple.  Such a
--    (subtree, list) tuple defines a set of objects and their
--    values to be collected as accounting data for a connection.
--    The subtree specifies a single OBJECT IDENTIFIER value such
--    that each object in the set is named by the subtree value
--    appended with a single additional sub-identifier.  The list
--    specifies a set of data items, where the presence of an item
--    in the list indicates that the item is (to be) present in
--    the data collected for a connection; the absence of an item
--    from the list indicates that the item is not (to be) present
--    in the data collected for a connection.  Each data item is
--    represented by an integer which when appended (as as
--    additional sub-identifier) to the OBJECT IDENTIFIER value of
--    the subtree identified by the tuple, is the name of an
--    object defining that data item (its description and its
--    syntax).
--    
--    The list is specified as an OCTET STRING in which each data
--    item is represented by a single bit, where data items 1
--    through 8 are represented by the bits in the first octet,
--    data items 9 through 16 by the bits in the second octet,
--    etc.  In each octet, the lowest numbered data item is
--    represented by the most significant bit, and the highest
--    numbered data item by the least significant bit.  A data
--    item is present in the list when its bit is set, and absent
--    when its bit is reset.  If the length of an OCTET STRING
--    value is too short to represent one or more data items
--    defined in a subtree, then those data items are absent from
--    
--    
--

        commands.  Over some transport/network protocols, it is
        possible for SNMP messages to get duplicated.  Such
        duplication, if it occurred at just the wrong time could
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        cause serious disruption to the collection and retrieval of
        accounting data, e.g., if a SNMP message setting
        acctngFileCommand to 'swapToNewFile' were to be duplicated,
        a whole file of accounting data could be lost.
        
        To protect against such duplication, a management
        application should retrieve the value of this object, and
        include in the Set operation needing protection, a variable
        binding which sets this object to the retrieved value."

                  to a new file; rather, it discards newly collected
                  data until a management application subsequently
                  instructs it to swap to a new file.
        
           'swapOnFull' - the agent terminates collection into the
