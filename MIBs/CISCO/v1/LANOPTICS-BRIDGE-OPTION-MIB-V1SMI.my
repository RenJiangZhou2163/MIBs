    DESCRIPTION
        "When LMGR session is active with PCRouter card through PCBus -

    ACCESS read-write
    STATUS mandatory
    DESCRIPTION
        "When LMGR session is active with PCRouter card through PCBus -
         this variable is by default enabled (1). It means that the Host 
         (SNMP Agent) tries to link to the LRM with the Control Link
         (id = 0). If this MIB variable is disabled the Host tries 
         to establish a session with the LRM through other links,
         and if succeeds, it doesn't try to capture link 0."
