--    This MIB was designed to complement the CISCO-RF-MIB by  
--    providing additional optional status and configuration control  
--    for redundant CPU platforms. 
--     
--    However, the MIB should also be applicable to redundant  
--    platforms which don't use the RF Redundancy Framework software  
--    since it makes no direct references to any CISCO-RF-MIB objects  
--    or textual conventions and no direct reference to any RF  
--    states, RF events or internal information. 
--     
--    Glossary of terms used in this document: 
--    
--        Active -   A redundant CPU which is actively controlling  
--                   the system. 
--    
--        Running configuration - The runtime configuration of a 
--                   system which reflects current configured  
--                   hardware or software settings. Runtime  
--                   configuration which is not stored in  
--                   non-volatile memory may be lost if the system 
--                   loses power. 
--    
--        Standby -  A redundant CPU which is not currently  
--                   controlling the system, but which can take  
--                   over control if the Active CPU fails. 
--    
--        Startup configuration - A copy of system configuration 
--                   stored in non-volatile memory which can be 
--                   applied following a system powerup. 
--    
--                   For platforms where all runtime configuration 
--                   is automatically stored in a non-volatile 
--                   manner, the running and startup configurations 
--                   are always identical. 
--    
--        Switchover - The transfer of control from one CPU to a  
--                   redundant CPU. 
--    
--        Sync -     The mirroring (or synchronizing) of system  
--                   state, configuration, statistics or other  
--                   information from the Active CPU to a Standby  
--                   CPU to allow it to maintain full system control         
--                   following a switchover.

cRfSupSysAvailableStartTime OBJECT-TYPE

    ACCESS read-only
    STATUS mandatory
    DESCRIPTION
        "The date and time when this system began providing  
        uninterrupted operation. This includes the time while either  
        redundant unit was Active, but may also include brief intervals  
        during switchover where the new Active unit was operational,  
        but not yet reachable for network management purposes. It may  
        also include intervals where no Standby unit was offering  
        protection, as long as the Active unit was still operational.   
         
        It normally changes only if an unprotected system restart 
        occurs or if a Standby unit was forced to take over before  
        the initial database sync was completed. 
        
        However, it may also change if the system's Time of Day clock  
        is changed or adjusted.  This object will be inaccurate if the 
        system's Time of Day clock has not been set accurately. However, 
        it should be implemented in such a way that when the system's  
        Time of Day clock is adjusted to an accurate setting,  
        cRfSupSysAvailableStartTime will also adjust to show the  
        accurate available start time."

    ACCESS read-only

    DESCRIPTION
        "The number of times that switchovers have occurred since 
        cRfSupSysAvailableStartTime. 
         
        This object will remain uninstantiated if no switchovers have

        This object will remain uninstantiated if no sync has yet 
        taken place since the current Active CPU was initialized 
        or if a Standby unit was forced to take over before the  
        initial database sync was completed. 
        
        Since automatic running configuration syncs are event driven  
        and can be disabled by configuration, this time doesn't 
        directly indicate whether Standby software reflects the 
        running configuration of the Active unit. 
         
        Instead, see the cRfSupSysRunningConfigOper object to

        Unlike some severity definitions, cRfSupCpuActiveSeverity

        Active unit, assuming the severity can be determined while  
        Standby. 
         
        The severity can be affected by either hardware or software  
        faults with the CPU itself. It can also be affected by faults 
        which prevent this CPU from interacting with one or more other 
        system components (such as linecards), even when the actual  
        faulty Field Replaceable Unit (FRU) is not the CPU itself. 
        
        As a minimum, the nonFaulty and fullyTrafficAffectingFault
