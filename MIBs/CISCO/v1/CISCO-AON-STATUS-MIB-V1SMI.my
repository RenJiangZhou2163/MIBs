--    This MIB module defines managed objects that facilitate the
--    management of AON node.
--    
--    The information available through this MIB includes
--    o AON node state i.e., whether the AON node is 'unregistered',
--    'registered', 'active', 'inactive'.
--    
--    o Node metrics information when a node is in the 'active'
--    state.
--    
--    o The node metrics information includes the number of messages
--    received by the node, number of PEPs deployed and number of
--    messages received by a PEP as well as information about the end
--    points that the messages are delivered to.  The metrics are
--    reset when the AON data plane is restarted.
--    
--    The following terms are used throughout this MIB:
--    
--    AON : Application Oriented Networking.

--                      Figure 2: AON Cloud
--    
--    Entry Node : The first node in an AON cloud, generally the one
--    closest to the client, is known as the Entry Node.  This node 
--    is also sometimes referred to as the Client Proxy.
--    
--    Exit Node : The ultimate node in an AON cloud, generally the
--    one closest to the server, is known as the Exit Node.  This 
--    node is also sometimes referred to as the Server Proxy.
--    
--    Intermediate Node : Any AON node in an AON cloud that is
--    neither directly communicating with the client or the server
--    (i.e. neither an Entry Node nor an Exit Node) is known as an
--    Intermediate Node.
--    
--    PEP : Policy Execution Plan.  A PEP is a sequence of bladelets
--    that determine how a message is processed in AON.
--    
--    MEP : Message Exchange Pattern.  MEP describes the pattern of
--    messages required by a communications protocol to establish or
--    use a communication channel. There are two major message       
--    exchange patterns: a request response pattern, and a one way
--    pattern.
--    
--    Bladelet : A bladelet is a piece of software that performs a
--    specific message handling function.  Bladelets are combined
--    together into PEPs.
--    
--    Send Bladelet : Routing bladelet that sends a message to a
--    selected destination.
--    
--    Notify Bladelet :  Bladelet for generating a custom
--    notification (either as SNMP trap or email) based on user
--    specified condition.
--    
--    NamedException : A NamedException is exposed by a bladelet as
--    connection points to identify a recoverable exception.  The
--    action to handle a NamedException thrown by a bladelet can be
--    explicitly designed in the PEP by associating a execution path
--    which comprises of a series of bladelet.
--    
--    Exception Block : It is the block in the PEP that is marked by
--    the exception marker and which is executed in case of a 
--    bladelet exception that is not a NamedException that has an
--    output path associated with it.
--    
--    URI : Uniform Resource Identifier.  A URI (Uniform Resource
--    Identifier) is the way you identify any content in the Internet
--    space, whether it be a page of text, a video or sound clip, a
--    still or animated image, or a program.
--    The most common form of URI is the Web page address, which is a
--    particular form or subset of URI called a Uniform Resource
--    Locator (URL).  A URI typically describes:
--    * mechanism used to access the resource
--    * specific computer that the resource is housed in
--    * specific name of the resource (a file name) on the computer.
--    
--    URL : Uniform Resource Locator.  A URL (Uniform Resource
--    Locator) is the unique Internet address for a file.  The URL
--    contains the name of the protocol to be used to access the file
--    resource, a domain name that identifies a specific computer on
--    the Internet, and a pathname, a hierarchical description that
--    specifies the location of a file in that computer.
--    
--    End point: An end point is an application that is either a
--    sender (client) or a receiver (server) of messages that
--    communicates with AON.
