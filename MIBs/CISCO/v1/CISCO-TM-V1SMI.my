snmpUDPVPNDomain OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { ciscoTransportMappings 1 }
-- OBJECT-IDENTITY
--  Status
--    mandatory
--  Descr
--    This transport domain is used to specify that particular
--    SNMP messages are to be sent/received over a particular
--    Virtual Private Network (VPN), implemented using MPLS
--    (Multiprotocol Label Switching).  The corresponding
--    transport address is of type SnmpUDPVPNAddress.
--    
--    A VPN is defined as a set of sites with a common
--    community of interest.  Sites within an MPLS-based VPN
--    often have private addresses which aren't accessible from
--    outside of the VPN, and may be duplicates of private
--    addresses used in other VPNs.  To uniquely identify such
--    a private address, it must be associated with a
--    particular VPN routing/forwarding instance, also known as
--    a VRF (VPN Routing and Forwarding table).
--  Refer
--    RFC 2547: BGP/MPLS VPNs

snmpAAL5Domain OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { ciscoTransportMappings 2 }
-- OBJECT-IDENTITY
--  Status
--    mandatory
--  Descr
--    This transport domain is used to specify that particular
--    SNMP messages are to be sent/received over AAL5 transport.
--    The corresponding transport address is of type 
--    SnmpAAL5VCIdentifier.
--    
--    An ATM VCC referenced by a SnmpAAL5VCIdentifier must be
--    used only for SNMP packets, and not for any other kind 
--    of packets. 
--    
--    Care must be taken with the use of this domain because its
--    associated transport address, SnmpAAL5VCIdentifier, 
--    contains identifiers which only have local and temporal 
--    uniqueness: ifIndex, VPI, VCI.
--    
--    Use of this transport mapping is not recommended, except 
--    in circumstances where an IP address is not available 
--    and thus a mapping over UDP, such as snmpUDPDomain, 
--    can not be used.

snmpCNSDomain OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { ciscoTransportMappings 3 }
-- OBJECT-IDENTITY
--  Status
--    mandatory
--  Descr
--    This transport domain is used for transporting
--     SNMP messages over the CNS Event Service. The
--     corresponding transport addresses are of type
--     SnmpCNSIdentifier.
--    
--     CNS Event service is an event based transport
--     mechanism. Events are published by producers
--     on particular subjects. Consumers listening
--     for these subjects receive the events.
--    
--     Point to point communication is provided on
--     the CNS Event Service by the use of Name Space
--     Mapper Service that uses the device-id, appended 
--     at the end of the subject, to locate a specific
--     target.
--    
--     An Event Agent subject used by a SnmpCNSIdentifier 
--     must be used only for SNMP events, and not for 
--     any other kind of events.
--    
--     Use of this transport mapping is not recommended, except 
--     in circumstances where an IP address is not available 
--     and thus a mapping over UDP, such as snmpUDPDomain, 
--     can not be used.

SnmpUDPVPNAddress ::= OCTET STRING(SIZE(7..38))
-- TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
--  DspHint
--    1d.1d.1d.1d/2d/32a
--  Status
--    mandatory
--  Descr
--    Represents a UDP VPN address:
--    
--     octets     contents            encoding
--      1-4       IP-address          network-byte order
--      5-6       UDP-port            network-byte order
--      7..38     VRF name            string of (up to 32) octets
--    IP address and port numbers should be represented in 
--    binary format.  String must contain printable characters.

SnmpAAL5VCIdentifier ::= OCTET STRING(SIZE(12))
-- TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
--  DspHint
--    4d/4d/4d
--  Status
--    mandatory
--  Descr
--    Represents a AAL5 VCC:
--    
--       octets       contents             encoding
--        1-4         ifIndex              network_byte order
--        5-8         vpi                  network-byte order
--        9-12        vci                  network-byte order
--     ifIndex, vpi and vci should be represented in binary
--     format.            
--     
--     ifIndex specifies the value of the ifIndex object
--     associated with the interface supporting the VCC.
--     vpi specifies the value of the VPI (Virtual Path
--     Identifier) associated with the VCC.
--     vci specifies the value of the VCI (Virtual Channel
--     Identifier) associated with the VCC.

SnmpCNSIdentifier ::= OCTET STRING(SIZE(19..274))
-- TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
--  DspHint
--    19a.255a
--  Status
--    mandatory
--  Descr
--    Represents the address that identifies targets
--     in the CNS Event Service Transport mapping.
--    
--      octets       contents             encoding
--      1-19       service-field   string of (19) octets   
--      20-274     device-id       string of (upto 255) octets 
--    
--     service-field specifies the type of service 
--     (request, response or notifications) and has a fixed 
--     length of 19 octets. It also serves the purpose of 
--     distinguishing SNMP Message events from other CNS Events.
--    
--     device-id uniquely identifies devices subscribed to
--     the CNS Event Service Bus. device-id may be same
--     as the hostname for the device.
--    
--     The device-id must be separated from the service-field by 
--     a '.'. If the device-id is omitted, SnmpCNSIdentifier
--     would contain just the fixed-length (19 octets)
--     service-field.
--    
--     Thus target addresses are CNS Event subjects of the
--     form: <service-field>.<device-id>
