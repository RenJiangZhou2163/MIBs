--    This is the MIB module for the Cisco specific extension
--    objects of Data Over Cable Service, Radio Frequency 
--    interface.  There is a standard MIB for Data-Over-Cable 
--    Service Interface Specifications (DOCSIS) and in Cisco,
--    it is called DOCS-IF-MIB. Besides the objects in 
--    DOCS-IF-MIB, this MIB module contains the extension 
--    objects to manage the Cable Modem Termination Systems 
--    (CMTS).
--    
--    This MIB module includes objects for the scheduler 
--    that supports Quality of Service (QoS) of MCNS/DOCSIS 
--    compliant Radio Frequency (RF) interfaces in Cable Modem 
--    Termination Systems (CMTS). And the purpose is to let 
--    users configure attributes of the schedulers in 
--    order to ensure the Quality of Service and fairness for 
--    modem requests according to users' business needs. 
--    Also this MIB shows various states of the schedulers 
--    for users to monitor of the schedulers' current status. 
--    
--    This MIB module also includes connection status objects
--    for cable modems and Customer Premise Equipment (CPE) 
--    and the purpose is to let users easily get the connection 
--    status and manage access group information about cable 
--    modems and CPE.
--    
--    This MIB module also includes objects for upstream 
--    configuration for automated spectrum management in 
--    order to mitigate upstream impairment.
--    
--    This MIB module also includes objects to keep count of
--    the total # of modems, # of registered and # of active
--    modems on the mac interface as well as each 
--    upstream.

    ACCESS read-write
    STATUS mandatory
    DESCRIPTION
        "To ensure fairness, the CMTS will throttle the rate for
        bandwidth request (upstream)/packet sent (downstream) at
        which CMTS issues grants(upstream) or allow packet to be
        send(downstream) such that the flow never gets more than
        its provisioned peak rate in bps. 
        
        There are two directions for every Service Id (Sid) traffic:
        downstream and upstream. Each direction is called a service
        flow here and assigned one token bucket with chosen 
        algorithm. 
        
        The enumerations for the rate limiting algorithm are:
         noRateLimit(1): The rate limiting is disabled. No rate
                         limiting.
         oneSecBurst(2): Bursty 1 second token bucket algorithm.
         carLike(3)    : Average token usage (CAR-like) algorithm
         wtExPacketDiscard(4) : Weighted excess packet discard 
                                algorithm.
         shaping(5): token bucket algorithm with shaping
        
        Upstream supports the following: 
          No rate limiting (1), 
          Bursty 1 second token bucket algorithm(2), 
          Average token usage (CAR-like) algorithm(3),
          Token bucket algorithm with shaping(5).
        
        Downstream supports the following:
          No rate limiting (1), 
          Bursty 1 second token bucket algorithm(2),
          Average token usage (CAR-like) algorithm(3),
          Weighted excess packet discard algorithm(4), and
          Token bucket algorithm with shaping(5).
        
        Token bucket algorithm with shaping is the
        default algorithm for upstream if CMTS is in DOCSIS 1.0 mode
        or DOCSIS 1.1 mode.
        
        
        Bursty 1 second token bucket algorithm is the 
        default algorithm for downstream if the CMTS is in
        DOCSIS 1.0 mode. If it is in DOCSIS 1.1 mode the default
        algorithm for downstream is  Token bucket algorithm with
        shaping .
        
        Each algorithm is described as below:
          No rate limiting: 
            The rate limiting process is disabled and no checking 
            against the maximum bandwidth allowed. 
        
          Bursty 1 second token bucket rate limiting algorithm: 
            In this algorithm, at the start of every 1 second
            interval, a service flow's token usage is reset to 0,
            and every time the modem for that service flow sends a
            request (upstream) / packet (downstream) the
            upstream/downstream bandwidth token usage is incremented
            by the size of the request/packet sent. As long as the
            service flow's bandwidth token usage is less than the
            maximum bandwidth in bits per second (peak rate limit)
            its QoS service class allows, the request/packets will
            not be restricted. 
            Once the service flow has sent more than its peak rate
            in the one second interval, it is prevented from sending
            more data by rejecting request (upstream) or dropping
            packets (downstream). This is expected to slow down
            the higher layer sources. The token usage counter gets
            reset to 0 after the 1 second interval has elapsed. The
            modem for that service flow is free to send more data
            up to the peak rate limit in the new 1 second interval
            that follows.  
        
          Average token usage (Cisco CAR like) algorithm: 
            This algorithm maintains a continuous average of the 
            burst token usage of a service flow. There is no sudden 
            refilling of tokens every 1 second interval. Every time
            a request/packet is to be handled, the scheduler tries
            to see how much time has elapsed since last transmission
            , and computes the number of tokens accumulated by this
            service flow at its QoS class peak rate. If burst usage
            of the service flow is less than tokens accumulated,
            the burst usage is reset to 0 and request/packet is
            forwarded. If the service flow has accumulated fewer
            tokens than its burst usage, the burst usage shows an
            outstanding balance usage after decrementing by the
            tokens accumulated. In such cases, the request/packet
            is still forwarded, provided the service flow's
            outstanding usage does not exceed peak rate limit of its
            QoS class. If outstanding burst usage exceeds the peak
            rate of the class, the service flow is given some token
            credit up to a certain maximum credit limit and the
            request/packet is forwarded. The request/packet is
            dropped when outstanding usage exceeds peak rate and
            maximum credit has been used up by this service flow.
            This algorithm tracks long term average bandwidth usage
            of the service flow and controls this average usage at
            the peak rate limit.
        
          Weighted excess packet discard algorithm:
            This rate limiting algorithm is only available as an
            option for downstream rate limiting. The algorithm is
            to maintain an weighted exponential moving average of
            the loss rate of a service flow over time. The loss
            rate, expressed in packets, represents the number of
            packets that can be sent from this service flow in a
            one second interval before a packet will be dropped.
            At every one second interval, the loss rate gets
            updated using the ratio between the flow peak rate (in
            bps) in its QoS profile and the service flow actual
            usage (in bps). If the service flow begins to send more
            than its peak rate continuously, the number of packets
            it can send in an one second interval before
            experiencing a drop will slowly keep reducing until
            cable modem for that service flow slows down as
            indicated by actual usage less or equal to the peak
            rate. 
        
          Token bucket algorithm with shaping:
             If there is no QoS class peak rate limit, forward the 
             request/packet without delay. If there is a QoS peak
             rate limit, every time a request/packet is to be
             handled, the scheduler determines the number of
             bandwidth tokens that this service flow has
             accumulated over the elapsed time at its QoS class peak
             rate and increments the tokens counter of the service
             flow accordingly.  The scheduler limits the token
             count to the maximum transmit burst (token bucket
             depth). If token count is greater than the number of
             tokens required to handle current request/packet,
             decrement token count by size of request/packet and
             forwards the request/packet without delay.  If token
             count is less than the size of request/packet, compute
             the shaping delay time after which the deficit number
             of tokens would be available. If shaping delay time is
             less than the maximum shaping delay, decrement tokens
             count by size of request/packet and forward this
             request/packet with the shaping delay in the shaping
             delay queue. When the delay time expires, the
             request/packet is forwarded. If shaping delay time is
             greater than the maximum shaping delay that the
             subsequent shaper can handle, the request/packet is
             dropped. Users can use cdxQosIfRateLimitShpMaxDelay to
             configure the the maximum shaping delay and
             cdxQosIfRateLimitShpGranularity to configure the

        maximum amount time of buffering the CMTS will allow for
        any rate exceeded flow.  If the max buffering delay is
        large, the grants/packets of the flow will be buffered for
        a longer period of time even though the flow is rate
        exceeded. This means fewer chances of drops for such rate
        exceeded flow. However, too large a max shaping delay
        can result is quick drainage of packet buffers at the CMTS,
        since several packets will be in the shaping (delay) queue
        waiting for their proper transmission time. Another
        important point to be noted is that delaying a flows packets
        (especially TCP flows) for extended periods of time is
        useless, since the higher protocol layers may assume a
        packet loss after a certain amount of time.
        
        The maximum shaping delay is only applied to rate limit
        algorithm: 
        Token bucket algorithm with shaping.  If the rate limit
        algorithm is not Token bucket algorithm with shaping, the
        value is always na(1) which is not applicable.
        
        If the token count is less than the size of request/packet,
        CMTS computes the shaping delay time after which the deficit
        number of tokens would be available. If the shaping delay
        time is greater than the maximum shaping delay, the
        request/packet will be dropped.  
        
        The enumerations for maximum shaping delay are:

        The shaping granularity is only applied to rate limit
        algorithm: Token bucket algorithm with shaping. It 
        controls how accurately the algorithm quantizes the shaping
        delay for a rate exceeded flow. If granularity is large,
        several shaping delay values will all be quantized to the
        same element in the queue resulting in less accurate rate
        shaping for the flows in bits/sec. On the other hand,
        choosing too small granularity causes more memory to be used
        for the shaper block, and also can cost a bit more in
        runtime overhead.
        
        If the rate limit algorithm is not Token bucket algorithm

        "The name code for the queue.
        
        cirQ :CIR queue. The queue is for Committed Information
              Rate (CIR) type of service which serves Service IDs
              which have minimum guaranteed rate in its QoS
              profile.  It is applicable if CMTS is running is
              either of DOCSIS 1.0 or 1.1 modes. For DOCSIS 1.1 it
              has priority 8.
        
        tbeQ :TBE Queue. The queue is for TIERED BEST EFFORT type 
              service which serves Service IDs which does not have
              minimum guaranteed rate in its QoS profile. It is 
              only applicable if CMTS is running in DOCSIS 1.0

        p0BEGrantQ-p7BEGrantQ : BEST EFFORT Queue
              The queues p0BEGrantQ to P7BEGrantQ are for TIERED

              which do not have minimum guaranteed rate specified
              in the QoS parameters. P0 has lowest priority and P7
              has highest. Best Effort type is purely handled with 
              prioritization in FIFO's and hence demands more 
              number of queues. These queues are applicable only if
              CMTS is running under mode DOCSIS 1.1.

                 is enabled on all cable interfaces using the 
                 mark option. In this mode, the CMTS allows

    DESCRIPTION
        "A CMTS operation entry to instruct a cable modem to move to
        a new downstream and/or upstream channel.
        
        A CMTS operator can use this to initiate an operation
        in CMTS to instruct a cable modem to move to a new
        downstream, or upstream channel or both. 
        
        Each entry consists of the mac address of the cable modem
        to be moved, a new downstream frequency, a new upstream
        channel id etc..  More than one entries could have for a
        cable modem, so there is a time stamp for each entry to
        show the time when this operation is initiated. 
        
        A management station wishing to create an entry should
        first generate a pseudo-random serial number to be used
        as the index to this sparse table.  The station should
        then create the associated instance of the row status
        object. It must also, either in the same or in successive
        PDUs, create the associated instance of the command and
        parameter objects. It should also modify the default values
        for any of the parameter objects if the defaults are not
        appropriate.
        
        Once the appropriate instances of all the command
        objects have been created, either by an explicit SNMP
        set request or by default, the row status should be set
        to active to initiate the operation. Note that this entire
        procedure may be initiated via a single set request which
        specifies a row status  of createAndGo as well as specifies
        valid values for the non-defaulted parameter objects.
        
        Once an operation has been activated, it cannot be stopped.
        That is, it will run until either the CMTS has generated 
        downstream frequency and/or upstream channel override
        fields in the RNG-RSP message sent to a cable modem or time
        out. In either case, the operation is completed.
        
        Once the operation is completed, the real result of the 
        operation to the cable modem cannot be known from this
        table. The result of the cable modem's downstream frequency
        and the upstream channel id can be checked from other MIB
        tables. For example, docsIfCmtsServiceTable from
        DOCS-IF-MIB can be used to check whether the cable modem's
        downstream frequency and upstream channel id are changed. 
        Please note that even the CMTS has generated downstream
        frequency and/or upstream channel override fields in the
        RNG-RSP message sent to a cable modems, if the cable modem
        cannot lock the instructed downstream frequency or no
        upstream channel id could be used, it may reconnect back to
        the original downstream frequency and upstream channel id. 
        
        Once the operation completes, the management station should
