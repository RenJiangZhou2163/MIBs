fcPingTable OBJECT-TYPE
    SYNTAX SEQUENCE OF FcPingEntry
    ACCESS not-accessible
    STATUS mandatory
    DESCRIPTION
        "A table of ping request entries. 
         This table contains a set of ping requests 
         which need to be executed at the agent."
    ::= { fcPingConfiguration 1 }

fcPingEntry OBJECT-TYPE
    SYNTAX FcPingEntry
    ACCESS not-accessible
    STATUS mandatory
    DESCRIPTION
        "A ping request entry. 
        
         A management station wishing to create an entry 
         should generate a pseudo-random number to be  
         used as an index into this table and create an  
         instance of the fcPingRowStatus object. After that,  
         the management station should set the corresponding  
         instance of fcPingAddress object with the address of  
         the destination that should be pinged and  
         fcPingVsanIndex with the desired VSAN number. 
        
         Once the appropriate instance of all the configuration 
         objects have been created, either by an explicit SNMP 
         set request or by default, the row status should be  
         set to active to initiate the ping sequence. Note that 
         this entire procedure may be initiated via a single 
         set request which specifies a row status of  
         createAndGo as well as specifies valid values for the  
         non-defaulted configuration objects.  
        
         Once the ping sequence has been initiated it can 
         be stopped by setting the corresponding instance 
         of fcPingRowStatus to 'destroy'. 
        
         The results of the ping operation are made available 
         in the fcPingStats table. For a ping entry uniquely 
         identified by fcPingIndex, an entry will be created  
         in the fcPingStats table automatically by the agent.  
        
         Once the ping sequence completes, the management  
         station should retrieve the statistics of interest  
         from the fcPingStats table and delete the entry from  
         the fcPingTable. The corresponding entry in the 
         fcPingStats table shall be deleted automatically by  
         the agent. 
        
         In order to prevent old entries from clogging the  
         table, entries will be aged out, but an entry will  
         never be deleted within fcPingAgeInterval  
         milliseconds of completing. 
        
         If the management station wishes to repeat the ping 
         sequence to a particular destination, then it will 
         need to set the corresponding instance of  
         fcPingAdminStatus to 'enable' again."
