--    This MIB module provides the management of

cdrqCmtsCmPollerEnable OBJECT-TYPE
    SYNTAX TruthValue
--    Rsyntax INTEGER {
--        true(1),
--        false(2)
--        }
    ACCESS read-write
    STATUS mandatory
    DESCRIPTION
        "An indication of whether the CMTS CM Poller is running. 
        
        When the poller is enabled, it polls the remote CMs  
        periodically specified in the cdrqCmtsCmPollerInterval 
        mib object. 
        
        cdrqCmtsCmPollerInterval and cdrqCmtsCmPollerCommunity 
        need to have valid values in order to be able to set 
        cdrqCmtsCmPollerEnable to TRUE. 
        
        The operation can be expensive depending on how many CMs  
        that the poller would be polling.  It is suggested to  
        have it disabled when not needed."

cdrqCmtsCmPollerInterval OBJECT-TYPE
    SYNTAX TimeInterval(0|1..8640000)
--    Rsyntax INTEGER(0|1..8640000)
    ACCESS read-write
    STATUS mandatory
    DESCRIPTION
        "An interval between two polling cycles of the CMTS CM  
        Poller.  
        
        The poller will not start the next cycle until it  
        finished polling for the last CM , even though the  
        time has expired.  If the cdrqCmtsCmPollerInterval is  
        too small with a large number of CMs, the poller would 
        tie up the CPU and resources and possibly degrade the 
        system's performance. 
        
        Any change in the cdrqCmtsCmPollerInterval will not 
        be reflected if the poller has already been enabled. 
        
        User cannot set cdrqCmtsCmPollerInterval to 0 but 
        will read 0 when CMTS is first restarted and remote-query 
        is not configured. Once poller is configured, 
        cdrqCmtsCmPollerInterval will retain the value even if 
        poller is later disabled"

    ACCESS read-write

    DESCRIPTION
        "The read community string is used for polling the CMs. 
        
        Any change in the cdrqCmtsCmPollerCommunity will not 
        be reflected if the poller has already been enabled. 
        
        For SNMPv3, this object will contain a user name  
        instead of a community string."

        context in which management information is accessed

    DESCRIPTION
        "The value of sysUpTime when the last polling cycle  
         started.  
        
        cdrqCmtsCmPollerStartTime is set to 0 when the CMTS  
        is first restarted and doesn't get reset after the  
        poller is disabled."

    ACCESS not-accessible
    STATUS mandatory
    DESCRIPTION
        "This table contains the status of the cable modems that  
        are polled by the CMTS CM Poller. The information will be  
        overwritten when a new polling cycle starts. 
        
        The removal of CM from the list or adding a new CM to the  
        list won't be reflected until the next polling cycle. 
        
        Depending on how many CMs that the poller is polling,  
        polling this table constantly can be quite expensive;  
        Therefore, it is best to poll upon receipt of the  
        cdrqCmtsCmRQDoneNotification. As a hedge against lost  
        notifications, periodic background polling should  
        be performed.  Howerver, excessive polling could  
        degrade performance."
