SpdTimePeriod ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
    DISPLAY-HINT "31t"
    STATUS       current
    DESCRIPTION
        "This property identifies an overall range of calendar dates
         and time.  In a boolean context, a value within this time
         range, inclusive, is considered true.

         This information is encoded as an octet string using
         the UTF-8 transformation format described in STD 63,
         RFC 3629.

         It uses the format suggested in RFC 3060.  An octet string
         represents a start date and time and an end date and time.
         For example:

         yyyymmddThhmmss/yyyymmddThhmmss

         Where: yyyy = year     mm = month     dd = day
                  hh = hour     mm = minute    ss = second

         The first 'yyyymmddThhmmss' sub-string indicates the start
         date and time.  The second 'yyyymmddThhmmss' sub-string
         indicates the end date and time.  The character 'T' within
         these sub-strings indicates the beginning of the time
         portion of each sub-string.  The solidus character '/'
         separates the start from the end date and time.  The end
         date and time MUST be subsequent to the start date and
         time.

         There are also two allowed substitutes for a
         'yyyymmddThhmmss' sub-string: one for the start date and
         time, and one for the end date and time.

         If the start date and time are replaced with the string
         'THISANDPRIOR', this sub-string would indicate the current
         date and time and the previous dates and time.

         If the end date and time are replaced with the string
         'THISANDFUTURE', this sub-string would indicate the current
         date and time and the subsequent dates and time.

         Any of the following SHOULD be considered a
         'wrongValue' error:
         - Setting a value with the end date and time earlier than
           or equal to the start date and time.
         - Setting the start date and time to 'THISANDFUTURE'.
         - Setting the end date and time to 'THISANDPRIOR'."

        "spdGroupContFilter points to a filter that is evaluated
         to determine whether the spdGroupContComponentName within
         this row is exercised.  Managers can use this object to
         classify groups of rules, or subgroups, together in order to
         achieve a greater degree of control and optimization over
         the execution order of the items within the group.  If the
         filter evaluates to false, the rule or subgroup will be
         skipped and the next rule or subgroup will be evaluated
         instead.  This value can be used to indicate a scalar or
         row in a table.  When indicating a row in a table, this
         value MUST point to the first column instance in that row.

         An example usage of this object would be to limit a
         group of rules to executing only when the IP packet
         being processed is designated to be processed by IKE.
         This effectively creates a group of IKE-specific rules.

         The following tables and scalars can be pointed to by this
         column.  All but diffServMultiFieldClfrTable are defined in
         this MIB:

                spdIpsoHeaderFilterTable

         Implementations MAY choose to provide support for other
         filter tables or scalars.

         If this column is set to a VariablePointer value, which
         references a non-existent row in an otherwise supported
         table, the inconsistentName exception MUST be returned.  If
         the table or scalar pointed to by the VariablePointer is
         not supported at all, then an inconsistentValue exception
         MUST be returned.

         If, during packet processing, a row in this table is applied
         to a packet and the value of this column in that row
         references a non-existent or non-supported object, the
         packet MUST be dropped."
