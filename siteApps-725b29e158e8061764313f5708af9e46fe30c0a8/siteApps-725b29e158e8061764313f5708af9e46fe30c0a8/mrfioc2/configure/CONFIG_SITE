# Make any application-specific changes to the EPICS build
# configuration variables in this file.

# Host/target specific settings can be specified in files named
#  CONFIG_SITE.$(EPICS_HOST_ARCH).Common
#  CONFIG_SITE.Common.$(T_A)
#  CONFIG_SITE.$(EPICS_HOST_ARCH).$(T_A)

# Set this when you only want to compile this application
# for a subset of the cross-compiled target architectures
# that Base is built for.
#CROSS_COMPILER_TARGET_ARCHS = vxWorks-68040

# Set this when your IOC and the host use different paths
# to access the application. This will be needed to boot
# from a Microsoft FTP server or with some NFS mounts.
# You must rebuild in the iocBoot directory for this to
# take effect.
#IOCS_APPL_TOP = <path to application top as seen by IOC>

# If you don't want to install into $(TOP) then
# define INSTALL_LOCATION here
