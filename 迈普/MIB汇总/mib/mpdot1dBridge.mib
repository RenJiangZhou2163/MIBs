Each octet within the value of this object specifies a set of eight ports, with the first octet specifying ports 1 through 8, the second octet specifying ports 9 through 16, etc.  Within each octet, the most significant bit represents the lowest numbered port, and the least significant bit represents the highest numbered port.  Thus, each port of the bridge is represented by a single bit within the value of this object.  If that bit has a value of '1' then that port is included in the set of ports; the port is not included if its bit has a value of '0'.  (Note that the setting of the bit corresponding to the port from which a frame is received is irrelevant.)  The default value of this object is a string of ones of appropriate length."

The default value is permanent(3). other(1) - this entry is currently in use but the conditions under which it will remain so are different from each of the following values. invalid(2) - writing this value to the object removes the corresponding entry. permanent(3) - this entry is currently in use and will remain so after the next reset of the bridge. deleteOnReset(4) - this entry is currently in use and will remain so until the next reset of the bridge. deleteOnTimeout(5) - this entry is currently in use and will remain so until it is aged out."
