--  DspHint
--    d
--  Status
--    mandatory
--  Descr
--    An integer which may be used as a new Index in a table.
--    
--    The special value of 0 indicates that no more new entries can be
--    created in the relevant table.
--    
--    When a MIB is used for configuration, an object with this SYNTAX
--    always contains a legal value (if non-zero) for an index that is
--    not currently used in the relevant table. The Command Generator
--    (Network Management Application) reads this variable and uses the
--    (non-zero) value read when creating a new row with an SNMP SET.
--    When the SET is performed, the Command Responder (agent) must
--    determine whether the value is indeed still unused; Two Network
--    Management Applications may attempt to create a row
--    (configuration entry) simultaneously and use the same value. If
--    it is currently unused, the SET succeeds and the Command
--    Responder (agent) changes the value of this object, according to
--    an implementation-specific algorithm.  If the value is in use,
--    
--    
--    
--    however, the SET fails.  The Network Management Application must
--    then re-read this variable to obtain a new usable value.
--    
--    An OBJECT-TYPE definition using this SYNTAX MUST specify the
--    relevant table for which the object is providing this
--    functionality.

        These are associated with individual interfaces, logical or

        the interface index must have been assigned, according to the
        procedures applicable to that, before it can be meaningfully
        used. Generally, this means that the interface must exist.
        
        When diffServDataPathStorage is of type nonVolatile, however,

        An entry in this table, pointed to by a RowPointer specifying an
        instance of diffServClfrStatus, is frequently used as the name
        for a set of classifier elements, which all use the index
        diffServClfrId. Per the semantics of the classifier element
        table, these entries constitute one or more unordered sets of
        tests which may be simultaneously applied to a message to
        
        
        
        classify it.
        
        The primary function of this table is to ensure that the value of
        diffServClfrId is unique before attempting to use it in creating
        a diffServClfrElementEntry. Therefore, the diffServClfrEntry must
        be created on the same SET as the diffServClfrElementEntry, or

        different types together.
        
        One example of a filter table defined in this MIB is
        diffServMultiFieldClfrTable, for IP Multi-Field Classifiers
        (MFCs). Such an entry might identify anything from a single
        micro-flow (an identifiable sub-session packet stream directed

        transports), or aggregates of those such as the traffic from a
        host, traffic for an application, or traffic between two hosts
        using an application and a given DSCP. The standard Behavior
        Aggregate used in the Differentiated Services Architecture is
        encoded as a degenerate case of such an aggregate - the traffic
        using a particular DSCP value.

        "The type of algorithm used by this dropper. The value other(1)
        requires further specification in some other MIB module.
        
        In the tailDrop(2) algorithm, diffServAlgDropQThreshold
        represents the maximum depth of the queue, pointed to by
        diffServAlgDropQMeasure, beyond which all newly arriving packets
        will be dropped.
        
        In the headDrop(3) algorithm, if a packet arrives when the
        current depth of the queue, pointed to by
        diffServAlgDropQMeasure, is at diffServAlgDropQThreshold, packets
        currently at the head of the queue are dropped to make room for
        the new packet to be enqueued at the tail of the queue.
        
        In the randomDrop(4) algorithm, on packet arrival, an Active
        Queue Management algorithm is executed which may randomly drop a
        packet. This algorithm may be proprietary, and it may drop either
        the arriving packet or another packet in the queue.
        diffServAlgDropSpecific points to a diffServRandomDropEntry that
        describes the algorithm. For this algorithm,
        
        
        
        diffServAlgDropQThreshold is understood to be the absolute
        maximum size of the queue and additional parameters are described
        in diffServRandomDropTable.
        
        The alwaysDrop(5) algorithm is as its name specifies; always
        drop. In this case, the other configuration values in this Entry
        are not meaningful; There is no useful 'next' processing step,
        there is no queue, and parameters describing the queue are not
        useful. Therefore, diffServAlgDropNext, diffServAlgDropMeasure,
