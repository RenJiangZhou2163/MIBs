--    The MIB module for the management of a group of
--    devices called a 'cluster'.  A cluster comprises:
--    
--    1. A command switch, which is a device that can provide
--       a single point of management (including SNMP, Web
--       Console and CLI/Telnet Console) for the devices
--       in the cluster;
--    
--    2. Zero or more expansion switches, or called the
--       cluster members throughout the context of this MIB,
--       which are devices that can be managed via a command
--       switch.  The command switch is also considered as a
--       cluster member.  Thus it has an entry in the MIB tables
--       defined below for cluster members.
--    
--    Only the command switch IP address, passwords, and SNMP
--    community strings need to be configured in order to
--    provide management access to members of the cluster.
--    
--    The Entity MIB is cross-referenced from this MIB for
--    some of its table entries, which contain useful
--    information about a cluster.  For example, in the
--    Entity MIB, there is the logical table which contains
--    the community string.  This information is used to
--    access detailed management information for some logical
--    entity (the cluster, in this case).
--    
--    To determine if a particular device can be a command switch
--    or a member switch please refer to the device's
--    user's guide.

--  RevDescr
--    Updated the imports such that Unsigned32 is imported from 
--    SNMPv2-SMI instead of CISCO-TC. Re-ordered the imports such 
--    that the SNMPv2 imports are imported first. Added a new 
--    NOTIFICATION GROUP ciscoClusterNotificationGroup to include
--    the notification ccStatusMemberStatusChange. Also deprecated the 
--    old MODULE-COMPLIANCE ciscoClusterCompliance, and added a new
--    MODULE-COMPLIANCE ciscoClusterComplianceRev1 such that its 
--    MANDATORY-GROUPS include this new NOTIFICATION GROUP and all the 
--    MANDATORY-GROUPS of ciscoClusterCompliance.
