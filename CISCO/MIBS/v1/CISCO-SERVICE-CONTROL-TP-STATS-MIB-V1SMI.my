--    This MIB provides information and statistics on the traffic
--    processor(s) of a service control entity, which is a network
--    element that monitors network traffic between network
--    subscribers based on user configured policies.
--    
--    A service control entity uses traffic processor(s) for packet
--    processing and flow handling in the host network.
--    
--    The traffic processor(s) data obtained from this MIB may also
--    reflect the general load in the system.
