--    The MIB module for management of network clock        distribution
--    and the Network Clock Distribution Protocol (NCDP) in Cisco 
--    devices.
--    
--    In the context of this MIB 'network clock' refers to the
--    clock signal that is used to time the physical interfaces.
--    Network clock distribution refers to the distribution of a
--    clock signal through a device and between devices for use
--    by the physical interfaces.  (See Bell Communications 
--    Research, GR-1244-CORE, 'Clocks for the Synchronized
--    Network: Common  Generic Criteria' and Bell Communications
--    Research, GR-436-CORE, 'Digital Network Synchronization 
--    Plan').
--    
--    NCDP is used to configure the network clocking hardware of 
--    the platform on which an NCDP entity exists.  The underlying
--    network clocking hardware in turn distributes a clock signal
--    through the device for use by the physical interfaces.  When
--    all of the interfaces that support synchronous clock 
--    recovery in a network are timed to one master clock signal,
--    the network is said to be synchronized.
--    
--     NCDP protocol entities residing on adjacent devices 
--    cooperate through the exchange of protocol messages to
--     construct a spanning network clock distribution tree.
--    The tree preserves the synchronous digital hierarchy.
--    
--    After NCDP has determined that its algorithm has converged
--    it superimposes the clock distribution tree on the
--    underlying network and the result is a synchronized
--    network.

        "The method used to distribute network clock for the device.
        When the mode of operation is 'ncdp', the services provided
        by the NCDP entity are in use.  When this is the case, NCDP
        entities residing on adjacent nodes exchange protocol 
        messages that are used by the resident NCDP entity to select
        clock source such that a network-wide clock distribution 
        tree is constructed.  When the mode of operation is manual,
        the NCDP entity is not in use and sources of network clock
        are statically configured.  When this is the case, the
        construction of a network-wide clock distribution tree is

    DESCRIPTION
        "The maximum possible height of a network clock distribution
        tree in the network.  (Alternatively this is known as the 
        maximum diameter of the network of devices that are 
        participating in NCDP.)  If all of the nodes in the network 
        are participating in the protocol then the maximum height of
        the network clock distribution tree is exactly the maximum
        diameter of the network.  If a proper subset of the nodes
        are participating in the NCDP then the maximum height of a
        network clock distribution tree is the maximum diameter of 
        the subnetwork induced by the removal of the 
        non-participating nodes and their associated links.
        
        The NCDP protocol entity uses the value of this object to
        determine when the NCDP algorithm has converged.  All 
        devices participating in NCDP within the bounds of the
        network must use the same value for maximum network diameter
        for the NCDP algorithm to operate properly. If the value of
        this object is set too small the resultant network may 
        exhibit unstable clocking characteristics and may constantly
        switch clock sources.  If the value is much larger than the
        network diameter, the algorithm will take longer to declare
        convergence than if the diameter were set closer to the 
        actual maximum network diameter, the result being that it 
        will take longer for the network to resynchronize after a 
        switchover to a secondary clock source located on a
        secondary device.
        
        This object is only used by the NCDP protocol entity."

    ACCESS read-write

    DESCRIPTION
        "The interval at which NCDP configuration PDUs are to be
        generated.
        
        The message interval directly affects the convergence time 
        of the NCDP algorithm.  Convergence time is equal to the max 
        network diameter * message interval + transmission delays + 
        the time a configuration PDU is spent being processed in  
        each device.  Thus if transmission delays and processing 
        delays are  both close to 0, the convergence time is
        approximately ( max network diameter * message interval )
        milliseconds.
        
        The value of cncNcdpHoldTime should normally match the value 
        of this object.
        
        This object is only used by the NCDP protocol entity."

    DESCRIPTION
        "The delay between the transmission of NCDP configuration
        PDUs.
        
        The hold time is used to limit the transmission of NCDP 
        configuration PDUs out of an interface to a maximum of one
        configuration PDU per hold time interval per interface.
        
        The value of this object should normally be set        to match the 
        value of cncNcdpMessageInterval.  If the value of this 
        object is higher than the value of cncNcdpMessageInterval,
        NCDP configuration PDUs will end up being propagated at
        the rate specified by the value of this object instead.

        has not changed.
        
        'lossOfLock' indicates that the clock source was 
        changed because the network clocking hardware lost 
        lock on the previous network clock source.
        
        'lossOfActivity' indicates that the clock source was changed
        because the network clocking hardware detected a loss of 
        activity on the previous network clock source.
        
        'ncdpRestructure' indicates that the NCDP entity has changed 
        the clock source as a result of a network-wide network clock 
        distribution tree restructuring process.

    DESCRIPTION
        "Network clock status and statistics for sources of network

        the managed system uses this table to select a source of 
        network clock for the managed system.  Within this table a
        physical entity that is a source of network clock is 
        identified by cncManualSourceId.  Table entries are indexed 
        by priority (cncManualSourcePriority).
        
        A source of network clock for the device may be an 
        oscillator local to the device, a Building Integrated
        Timing Supply (BITS) port or an interface that supports
        synchronous clock  recovery. (BITS is explained in more

        When the managed system initializes it creates a row for 
        the device's default source of network clock, (the entry
        having cncManualSourcePriority with value 'default').  The
        only operations allowed on the columnar objects in this
        particular row are read operations.
        
        Other rows are created or destroyed by a management station
        or through the device's local management interface when a 
        source of network clock is configured or removed.  When a
        management station creates a row it creates it explicitly 
        using RowStatus with either createAndGo or createAndWait.
        A row is not made active until a valid value for
        cncManualSourceId is supplied.  A management station may
        perform a write operation on any columnar object while the
        row is active or not in service.
        
        The value of any instance of cncManualSourceId located in

        "Network clock status and statistics for sources of network
        clock identified by entPhysicalIndex and used by the managed
        system when the value of cncDistributionMethod is 'ncdp'.
        
        A source of network clock for the device may be an
        oscillator local to the device, a Building Integrated Timing
        Supply (BITS) port or an interface that supports synchronous
        clock recovery.
        (BITS is explained in more detail in Bell Communications
        Research, GR-436-CORE, 'Digital Network Synchronization 
        Plan'.)
        
        The NCDP protocol entity selects one entry in this table to
        advertise as the best available clock source for the device.
        Cooperating NCDP protocol entities select the best available
        clock source among those advertised within the cooperating
        group and build a clock        distribution tree rooted at that 
        clock source.  When the value of cncRootClockSource is used
        as an index into this table and the indicated clock source
        has cncNcdpBestClockSource with value 'true' then the
        indicated clock source is the root of some clock
        distribution tree.  If only one such root exists on all 
        participating devices in the network, then it is the root of
        a network wide clock distribution tree.
        
        When the managed system initializes it creates a row for the
        device's default source of network clock.  This row cannot be
        destroyed by a management station.  Within this row a write
        operation is only allowed on the cncNcdpPriority object; only
        read operations are allowed on all other columnar objects
        within this specific row.  The status of this row is always
        active.  The default source can always be found by issuing a
        read operation on the row within cncManualSourceTable indexed
        by 'default' (as the value of cncManualSourcePriority).  The
        cncManualSourceId object contains the entPhysicalIndex of the
        default source of network clock and identifies it within this
        table.
        
        Other rows are created or destroyed by a management station
        or through the device's local management interface when a 
        source of network clock is configured or removed.  When a
        management station creates a row it creates it explicitly  
        using RowStatus with either createAndGo or createAndWait. 
        A row is not made active until all read-create objects not 
        having default values are properly initialized.
        
        The values of cncNcdpPriority, cncNcdpStratum and
        cncNcdpPRSReference collectively describe a source of network
        clock, that is they are three components of a vector used as 
        an input to the NCDP algorithm to make clock source selection
