--    Remote network monitoring devices, often called
--    monitors or probes, are instruments that exist for
--    the purpose of managing a network. This MIB defines
--    objects for managing remote network monitoring devices.

--  RevDescr
--    Bug fixes, clarifications and minor changes based on
--    implementation experience, published as RFC1757 [18].
--    
--    Two changes were made to object definitions:
--    
--    1) A new status bit has been defined for the
--    captureBufferPacketStatus object, indicating that the
--    packet order within the capture buffer may not be identical to
--    the packet order as received off the wire.  This bit may only
--    be used for packets transmitted by the probe.  Older NMS
--    applications can safely ignore this status bit, which might be
--    used by newer agents.
--    
--    2) The packetMatch trap has been removed.  This trap was never
--    actually 'approved' and was not added to this document along
--    with the risingAlarm and fallingAlarm traps. The packetMatch
--    trap could not be throttled, which could cause disruption of
--    normal network traffic under some circumstances. An NMS should
--    configure a risingAlarm threshold on the appropriate
--    channelMatches instance if a trap is desired for a packetMatch
--    event. Note that logging of packetMatch events is still
--    supported==only trap generation for such events has been
--    removed.
--    
--    In addition, several clarifications to individual object
--    definitions have been added to assist agent and NMS
--    implementors:
--    
--    - global definition of 'good packets' and 'bad packets'
--    
--    - more detailed text governing conceptual row creation and
--      modification
--    
--    - instructions for probes relating to interface changes and
--      disruptions
--    
--    - clarification of some ethernet counter definitions
--    
--    - recommended formula for calculating network utilization
--    
--    - clarification of channel and captureBuffer behavior for some
--      unusual conditions
--    
--    - examples of proper instance naming for each table

OwnerString ::= OCTET STRING(SIZE(0..127))
-- TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
--  Status
--    mandatory
--  Descr
--    This data type is used to model an administratively
--    assigned name of the owner of a resource. Implementations
--    must accept values composed of well-formed NVT ASCII
--    sequences. In addition, implementations should accept
--    values composed of well-formed UTF-8 sequences.
--    
--    It is suggested that this name contain one or more of
--    the following: IP address, management station name,
--    network manager's name, location, or phone number.
--    In some cases the agent itself will be the owner of
--    an entry.  In these cases, this string shall be set
--    to a string starting with 'monitor'.
--    
--    SNMP access control is articulated entirely in terms
--    of the contents of MIB views; access to a particular
--    SNMP object instance depends only upon its presence
--    or absence in a particular MIB view and never upon
--    its value or the value of related object instances.
--    Thus, objects of this type afford resolution of
--    resource contention only among cooperating
--    managers; they realize no access control function
--    with respect to uncooperative parties.

EntryStatus ::= INTEGER {
        valid(1),

--    The status of a table entry.
--    
--    Setting this object to the value invalid(4) has the
--    effect of invalidating the corresponding entry.
--    That is, it effectively disassociates the mapping
--    identified with said entry.
--    It is an implementation-specific matter as to whether
--    the agent removes an invalidated entry from the table.
--    Accordingly, management stations must be prepared to
--    receive tabular information from agents that corresponds
--    to entries currently not in use.  Proper
--    interpretation of such entries requires examination
--    of the relevant EntryStatus object.
--    
--    An existing instance of this object cannot be set to
--    createRequest(2).  This object may only be set to
--    createRequest(2) when this instance is created.  When
--    this object is created, the agent may wish to create
--    supplemental object instances with default values
--    to complete a conceptual row in this table.  Because the
--    creation of these default objects is entirely at the option
--    of the agent, the manager must not assume that any will be
--    created, but may make use of any that are created.
--    Immediately after completing the create operation, the agent
--    must set this object to underCreation(3).
--    
--    When in the underCreation(3) state, an entry is allowed to
--    exist in a possibly incomplete, possibly inconsistent state,
--    usually to allow it to be modified in multiple PDUs.  When in
--    this state, an entry is not fully active.
--    Entries shall exist in the underCreation(3) state until
--    the management station is finished configuring the entry
--    and sets this object to valid(1) or aborts, setting this
--    object to invalid(4).  If the agent determines that an
--    entry has been in the underCreation(3) state for an
--    abnormally long time, it may decide that the management
--    station has crashed.  If the agent makes this decision,
--    it may set this object to invalid(4) to reclaim the
--    entry.  A prudent agent will understand that the
--    management station may need to wait for human input
--    and will allow for that possibility in its
--    determination of this abnormally long period.
--    
--    An entry in the valid(1) state is fully configured and
--    consistent and fully represents the configuration or
--    operation such a row is intended to represent.  For
--    example, it could be a statistical function that is
--    configured and active, or a filter that is available
--    in the list of filters processed by the packet capture
--    process.
--    
--    A manager is restricted to changing the state of an entry in
--    the following ways:
--    
--         To:       valid  createRequest  underCreation  invalid
--    From:
--    valid             OK             NO             OK       OK
--    createRequest    N/A            N/A            N/A      N/A
--    underCreation     OK             NO             OK       OK
--    invalid           NO             NO             NO       OK
--    nonExistent       NO             OK             NO       OK
--    
--    In the table above, it is not applicable to move the state
--    from the createRequest state to any other state because the
--    manager will never find the variable in that state.  The
--    nonExistent state is not a value of the enumeration, rather
--    it means that the entryStatus variable does not exist at all.
--    
--    An agent may allow an entryStatus variable to change state in
--    additional ways, so long as the semantics of the states are
--    followed.  This allowance is made to ease the implementation of
--    the agent and is made despite the fact that managers should
--    never exercise these additional state transitions.

    DESCRIPTION
        "This object identifies the source of the data that
        this etherStats entry is configured to analyze.  This
        source can be any ethernet interface on this device.
        In order to identify a particular interface, this object
        shall identify the instance of the ifIndex object,
        defined in RFC 2233 [17], for the desired interface.
        For example, if an entry were to receive data from
        interface #1, this object would be set to ifIndex.1.
        
        The statistics in this group reflect all packets
        on the local network segment attached to the identified
        interface.
        
        An agent may or may not be able to tell if fundamental
        changes to the media of the interface have occurred and
        necessitate an invalidation of this entry.  For example, a
        hot-pluggable ethernet card could be pulled out and replaced
        by a token-ring card.  In such a case, if the agent has such
        knowledge of the change, it is recommended that it
        invalidate this entry.
        
        This object may not be modified if the associated

        "The total number of octets of data (including
        those in bad packets) received on the
        network (excluding framing bits but including
        FCS octets).
        This object can be used as a reasonable estimate of
        10-Megabit ethernet utilization.  If greater precision is
        desired, the etherStatsPkts and etherStatsOctets objects
        should be sampled before and after a common interval.  The
        differences in the sampled values are Pkts and Octets,
        respectively, and the number of seconds in the interval is
        Interval.  These values are used to calculate the Utilization
        as follows:
        
                         Pkts * (9.6 + 6.4) + (Octets * .8)
         Utilization = -------------------------------------
                                 Interval * 10,000
        
        The result of this equation is the value Utilization which
        is the percent utilization of the ethernet segment on a
        scale of 0 to 100 percent."

    DESCRIPTION
        "The best estimate of the total number of collisions
        on this Ethernet segment.
        
        The value returned will depend on the location of the
        RMON probe. Section 8.2.1.3 (10BASE-5) and section
        10.3.1.3 (10BASE-2) of IEEE standard 802.3 states that a
        station must detect a collision, in the receive mode, if
        three or more stations are transmitting simultaneously.  A
        repeater port must detect a collision when two or more
        stations are transmitting simultaneously.  Thus a probe
        placed on a repeater port could record more collisions
        than a probe connected to a station on the same segment
        would.
        
        Probe location plays a much smaller role when considering
        10BASE-T.  14.2.1.4 (10BASE-T) of IEEE standard 802.3
        defines a collision as the simultaneous presence of signals
        on the DO and RD circuits (transmitting and receiving
        at the same time).  A 10BASE-T station can only detect
        collisions when it is transmitting.  Thus probes placed on
        a station and a repeater, should report the same number of
        collisions.
        
        Note also that an RMON probe inside a repeater should
        ideally report collisions between the repeater and one or
        more other hosts (transmit collisions as defined by IEEE
        802.3k) plus receiver collisions observed on any coax
        segments to which the repeater is connected."

        The value returned will depend on the location of the
        RMON probe. Section 8.2.1.3 (10BASE-5) and section
        10.3.1.3 (10BASE-2) of IEEE standard 802.3 states that a
        station must detect a collision, in the receive mode, if
        three or more stations are transmitting simultaneously.  A
        repeater port must detect a collision when two or more
        stations are transmitting simultaneously.  Thus a probe
        placed on a repeater port could record more collisions
        than a probe connected to a station on the same segment
        would.
        
        Probe location plays a much smaller role when considering
        10BASE-T.  14.2.1.4 (10BASE-T) of IEEE standard 802.3
        defines a collision as the simultaneous presence of signals
        on the DO and RD circuits (transmitting and receiving
        at the same time).  A 10BASE-T station can only detect
        collisions when it is transmitting.  Thus probes placed on
        a station and a repeater, should report the same number of
        collisions.
        
        Note also that an RMON probe inside a repeater should
        ideally report collisions between the repeater and one or
        more other hosts (transmit collisions as defined by IEEE
        802.3k) plus receiver collisions observed on any coax

            bit from the packet status is equal to the corresponding
            bit from the filterPktStatus, then the packet will fail
            this status match.
        
        Any packets that have not failed either of the two matches
        above have passed this status match.  In particular, a zero
        length status filter will match any packet's status.
        
        The value of the packet status is a sum.  This sum
        initially takes the value zero.  Then, for each
        error, E, that has been discovered in this packet,
        2 raised to a value representing E is added to the sum.
        The errors and the bits that represent them are dependent
        on the media type of the interface that this channel
        is receiving packets from.
        
        The errors defined for a packet captured off of an
        Ethernet interface are as follows:
        
            bit #    Error
                0    Packet is longer than 1518 octets
                1    Packet is shorter than 64 octets
                2    Packet experienced a CRC or Alignment error
        
        For example, an Ethernet fragment would have a
        value of 6 (2^1 + 2^2).
        
        As this MIB is expanded to new media types, this object
        will have other media-specific errors defined.
        
        For the purposes of this status matching algorithm, if the
        packet status is longer than this filterPktStatus object,
        this object is conceptually extended with '0' bits until it
        reaches the size of the packet status.
        
        This object may not be modified if the associated
        filterStatus object is equal to valid(1)."
