--    This MIB contains the basic objects for managing a
--    Cisco Appliance Services Architecture (CASA) Entity. A
--    CASA Entity can be a Manager or a Forwarding Agent as
--    defined below. The basic objects included in this mib
--    are those to configure CASA, retrieve CASA's state and
--    information about the fixed affinity cache.
--    
--    The following gives a list of definitions and a
--    description of how Service Managers and Forwarding
--    Agents interact. For a more detailed description, see
--    the Cisco Appliance Services Architecture (CASA)
--    document.
--    
--    CASA is a protocol allowing software entities (called
--    Appliances, examples are web caches, firewalls, load
--    balancers) to control the behavior of network hardware
--    devices (called Forwarding Agents, examples are
--    switches or routers) by providing a set of rules used
--    to handle network traffic.
--    
--    A Network Appliance (referred to as an Appliance) is
--    any subsystem whose purpose is to provide a specific
--    additional value-added service to the network device,
--    and could be implemented as a standalone box, a line
--    card or processor card, or a software subsystem.
--    Examples of Network Appliances would include Load
--    Balancers, WebCaches, and Firewalls.
--    
--    An Appliance tells Fowarding Agents how to handle
--    packets based on their source and destination IP
--    addresses and ports, and IP protocol fields.  This set
--    of information is called an Affinity.
--    
--    A Service Manager is an Appliance that requests
--    packet flows from Forwarding Agents through CASA.
--    
--    A Real Server is a physical computing engine or part
--    of that physical computing engine that offers one or
--    more application services to a set of clients in the
--    network.
--    
--    A packet flow is a TCP connection or a sequence of UDP
--    packets between a client and a specific Real Server,
--    pertaining to a specific application. Flows are
--    represented by entries in the affinity cache tables.
--    
--    The Service Manager requests packet flows from
--    Forwarding Agents by sending Affinities which contains
--    wildcards on some of the Affinity fields. Affinities
--    that contain wildcards in some of the fields are
--    called Wildcard Affinities.  The Service Manager may
--    send the Forwarding Agent an Affinity containing
--    explicit values for each of the fields.  These
--    Affinities are called Fixed Affinities.
--    
--    Typically Wildcard Affinities are used to instruct the
--    Forwarding Agent to send packets received by the
--    Forwarding Agent, which match the Wildcard Affinity,
--    to the Service Manager. When the Service Manager
--    receives the matching packet, the Service Manager
--    typically will send the Forwarding Agent a Fixed
--    Affinity. The Forwarding Agent uses Fixed Affinities
--    to match packets coming from the network, execute any
--    processing required on that packet, and forward that
--    packet to a destination IP address (designated in the
--    Fixed Affinity) called the Dispatch Address.
--    
--    When an IP packet arrives at the Forwarding Agent, the
--    Forwarding Agent attempts to match the packet with the
--    Fixed Affinities in the Fixed Affinity cache.  If
--    there is no match, an attempt is made to match the
--    packet with the list of Wildcard Affinities. If there
--    is no match the packet is routed normally. If there is
--    a match with a Wildcard Affinity, the Forwarding Agent
--    sends the packet to the Service Manager who will send
--    the Forwarding Manager a Fixed Affinity which provides
--    information on how to process IP packets similar to
--    the one received by the Forwarding Agent. Processing
--    of such packets may include sending the packet to the
--    Service Manager. Such packets are called Interest
--    Packets.  Alternatively a Tickle Packet may be sent to
--    the Service Manager which is an indication that a
--    matched packet has been received by the Forwarding
--    Agent.
