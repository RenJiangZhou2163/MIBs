--    The MIB module to describe generic objects for
--    ethernet-like network interfaces.
--    
--    The following reference is used throughout this
--    MIB module:
--    
--    [IEEE 802.3 Std] refers to:
--       IEEE Std 802.3, 2002 Edition: 'IEEE Standard
--       for Information technology -
--       Telecommunications and information exchange
--       between systems - Local and metropolitan

--       Part 3: Carrier sense multiple access with
--       collision detection (CSMA/CD) access method
--       and physical layer specifications', as
--       amended by IEEE Std 802.3ae-2002:
--       'Amendment: Media Access Control (MAC)

--       Parameters for 10 Gb/s Operation', August,

--  RevDescr
--    Updated to include support for 10 Gb/sec
--     interfaces.  This resulted in the following
--     revisions:
--    
--     - Updated dot3StatsAlignmentErrors and
--       dot3StatsSymbolErrors DESCRIPTIONs to
--       reflect behaviour at 10 Gb/s
--     - Added dot3StatsRateControlAbility and
--       dot3RateControlStatus for management
--       of the Rate Control function in 10 Gb/s
--       WAN applications
--     - Added 64-bit versions of all counters
--       that are used on high-speed ethernet
--       interfaces
--     - Added object groups to contain the new
--       objects
--     - Deprecated etherStatsBaseGroup and
--       split into etherStatsBaseGroup2 and
--       etherStatsHalfDuplexGroup, so that
--       interfaces which can only operate at
--       full-duplex do not need to implement
--       half-duplex-only statistics
--     - Deprecated dot3Compliance and replaced
--       it with dot3Compliance2, which includes
--       the compliance information for the new
--       object groups
--    
--     In addition, the dot3Tests and dot3Errors
--     object identities have been deprecated,
--     since there is no longer a standard method
--     for using them.
--    
--     This version published as RFC 3635.

--    The Time-Domain Reflectometry (TDR) test is
--    specific to ethernet-like interfaces of type
--    10Base5 and 10Base2.  The TDR value may be
--    useful in determining the approximate distance
--    to a cable fault.  It is advisable to repeat
--    this test to check for a consistent resulting
--    TDR value, to verify that there is a fault.
--    
--    A TDR test returns as its result the time
--    interval, measured in 10 MHz ticks or 100 nsec
--    units, between the start of TDR test
--    transmission and the subsequent detection of a
--    collision or deassertion of carrier.  On
--    successful completion of a TDR test, the result
--    is stored as the value of an appropriate
--    instance of an appropriate vendor specific MIB
--    object, and the OBJECT IDENTIFIER of that
--    instance is stored in the appropriate instance
--    of the appropriate test result code object
--    (thereby indicating where the result has been
--    stored).
--    
--    This object identity has been deprecated, since
--    the ifTestTable in the IF-MIB was deprecated,
--    and there is no longer a standard mechanism for
--    initiating an interface test.  This left no
--    standard way of using this object identity.

--    This test configures the MAC chip and executes
--    an internal loopback test of memory, data paths,
--    and the MAC chip logic.  This loopback test can
--    only be executed if the interface is offline.
--    Once the test has completed, the MAC chip should
--    be reinitialized for network operation, but it
--    should remain offline.
--    
--    If an error occurs during a test, the
--    appropriate test result object will be set
--    to indicate a failure.  The two OBJECT
--    IDENTIFIER values dot3ErrorInitError and
--    dot3ErrorLoopbackError may be used to provided
--    more information as values for an appropriate
--    test result code object.

        The count represented by an instance of this
        object is incremented when the frameTooLong
        status is returned by the MAC service to the
        LLC (or other MAC user). Received frames for
        which multiple error conditions pertain are,
        according to the conventions of IEEE 802.3
        Layer Management, counted exclusively according
        to the error status presented to the LLC.
        
        For interfaces operating at 10 Gb/s, this
        counter can roll over in less than 80 minutes if
        it is incrementing at its maximum rate.  Since
        that amount of time could be less than a

        This object contains an OBJECT IDENTIFIER
        which identifies the chipset used to
        realize the interface. Ethernet-like
        interfaces are typically built out of
        several different chips. The MIB implementor
        is presented with a decision of which chip
        to identify via this object. The implementor
        should identify the chip which is usually
        called the Medium Access Control chip.
        If no such chip is easily identifiable,
        the implementor should identify the chip
        which actually gathers the transmit
        and receive statistics and error
        indications. This would allow a
        manager station to correlate the
        statistics and the chip generating
        them, giving it the ability to take
        into account any known anomalies
        in the chip.
        
        This object has been deprecated.  Implementation
        feedback indicates that it is of limited use for
        debugging network problems in the field, and
        the administrative overhead involved in
        maintaining a registry of chipset OIDs is not

        Management control of the duplex mode is

        For interfaces operating at 10 Gb/s, this

        that amount of time could be less than a
        management station's poll cycle time, in order
        to avoid a loss of information, a management
        station is advised to poll the
        dot3HCOutPauseFrames object for 10 Gb/s or

        The counters that have 64-bit versions in this
        table are the counters that apply to full-duplex
        interfaces, since 10 Gb/s and faster
        ethernet-like interfaces do not support
        half-duplex, and very few 1000 Mb/s
        ethernet-like interfaces support half-duplex.
        
        Entries in this table are recommended for
        interfaces capable of operating at 1000 Mb/s or
        faster, and are required for interfaces capable
        of operating at 10 Gb/s or faster.  Lower speed
        ethernet-like interfaces do not need entries in
        this table, in which case there may be fewer
        entries in this table than in the
        dot3StatsTable. However, implementations
