         For UDP-based fax transport, its value should be set

         A value of networkTCF implies that date rate management

         in a manner similar to the PSTN(Public Switched  
         Telephone Network). In this case, the TCF training 
         signal is passed transparently by the IP network.  
        
         A value of localTCF implies that media gateways are actively  
         involved in the training and data rate management procedure,  
         including the generation of the TCF training signal. 
         Data rate management is done by one of the media gateways on  
         the basis of local results and results forwarded over the IP

    DESCRIPTION
        "This object is used to enable/disable the gateway to

         following T.30 signals: NSF, NSC (Non-Standard Facilities 
         Command) and NSS (Non-Standard Facilities Set-up). The 
         NSF code is overridden to prevent the group 3 fax 
         machines from synchronizing with each other on the basis 
         of a protocol other the ITU T-series recommendations. 
         If this proprietary synchronization is prevented, the 
         group 3 fax machines will synchronize to the standard 
         T-series protocol. This action is necessary if the fax 
         relay capability of the media gateway is limited  
         to the T-series recommendations. As defined in T.35, the NSF  
         code consists of a one-byte Country Code, a two-byte  
         Terminal Provider Code (also called the Vendor Code), and a  
         variable-length (up to 255 bytes) Terminal Provider-Oriented  
         Code. If t38NSFOverride is enabled, the Country Code and  
         Terminal Provider Code are overridden with the values of the  
         t38NSFCountryCode and t38NSFVendorCode respectively, while 
         the Terminal Provider-Oriented Code (which is a bit-map of 
         manufacturer-specific capabilities) is set to all-zeros. "

t38NSFCountryCode OBJECT-TYPE
    SYNTAX INTEGER(0..65535)
    ACCESS read-write
    STATUS mandatory
    DESCRIPTION
        "The Country Code in the NSF code is a  
         single-byte field identifying the country where 
         the group 3 fax equipment with non-standard  
         capabilities were manufactured.  
        
         There are un ratified proposals on the table to extend  
         this to a two-byte field. If the fax relay capability of the 
         gateway is limited to the ITU T-series protocol, the value  
         of the t38NSFCountryCode object is to be written into the  
         Country Code field to preclude non-standard synchronization  
         of the group 3 faxs terminals.  
         Since a value of 0x00 refers to Japan, and a value of 0xFF  
         is a Country Code extension mechanism, these cannot be used  
         to disable non-standard synchronization.  
        
         The t38NSFCountryCode value used to override NSF-based 
         synchronization is 0xAD (173).  
         If the Country Code is extended to two bytes in the future,  
         the second byte will be set to 0x00. In conjunction with 
         this Country Code, a t38NSFVendorCode value of 0x0051 
         is used for NSF suppression. It is not possible to use a  
         value of 0x0000 for this suppression since it refers to 
         Compression Labs.  
         To realize NSF suppression, all bytes in the Terminal  
         Provider-Oriented Code field, which describes the  
         manufacturer-specific capabilities,  are set to zeros. "

         If the fax relay capability of the gateway is limited to  
         the ITU T-series protocol, the value of the t38NSFVendorCode  
         object is to be written into the Vendor Code

         synchronization of the group 3 fax terminals. 
        
         Since a value of 0x0000 refers to Compression Labs, it 
         cannot be used to disable non-standard synchronization.   
         The t38NSFVendorCode value used to override NSF-based  
         synchronization is 0x0051 (81).   
         To realize NSF suppression, this is used in conjunction with  
         the appropriate Country Code referring to the United States,  
         and in conjunction with the setting of all bytes in the
