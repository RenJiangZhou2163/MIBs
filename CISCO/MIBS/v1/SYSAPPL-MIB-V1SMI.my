--    The MIB module defines management objects that model
--    applications as collections of executables and files
--    installed and executing on a host system.  The MIB
--    presents a system-level view of applications; i.e.,
--    objects in this MIB are limited to those attributes
--    that can typically be obtained from the system itself
--    without adding special instrumentation to the applications.

        determination of application health. The default value,
        unknown(5), is used when an operator has not yet assigned
        one of the other values.  If unknown(5) is set, bits
        1 - 4 have no meaning.  The possible values are:
        
                executable(0),
                    An application may have one or

                    as the primary executable.  The execution of
                    this element constitutes an invocation of
                    the application.  This is used by the agent
                    implementation to determine the initiation of
                    an application.  The primary executable must
                    remain running long enough for the agent
                    implementation to detect its presence.
                required(3),
                    An application may have zero or more required
                    elements. All required elements must be running
                    in order for the application to be judged to be

         sysApplInstallElmtRole is used by the agent implementation
         in determining the initiation of an application, the

        "A history of the applications that have previously run

        this table from the sysApplRunTable when the invoked
        application represented by the entry ceases to be running.
        
        An agent implementation can determine that an application
        invocation is no longer running by evaluating the running
        elements of the application instance and their Roles as
        defined by sysApplInstallElmtRole.  Obviously, if there
        are no running elements for the application instance,
        then the application invocation is no longer running.
        If any one of the REQUIRED elements is not running,
        the application instance may be in the process of exiting.
        Most agent implementations will wait until a second internal
        poll has been completed to give the system time to either
        restart partial failures or to give all elements time to
        exit.  If, after the second poll, there are REQUIRED
        elements that are not running, then the application
        instance may be considered by the agent implementation
        to no longer be running.
        
        Entries remain in the sysApplPastRunTable until they
        are aged out when either the table size reaches a maximum

    DESCRIPTION
        "The sole purpose of this table is to provide a

        sysApplElmtRunIndex (process identification number),
        the corresponding invoked application (sysApplRunIndex),
        installed element (sysApplInstallElmtIndex), and
        installed application package (sysApplInstallPkgIndex)
        can be quickly determined.
        
        This table will contain one entry for each process
        that is currently executing on the system.
        
        It is expected that management applications will use
        this mapping table by doing a 'GetNext' operation with
        the known process ID number (sysApplElmtRunIndex) as the
        partial instance identifier.  Assuming that there is an
        entry for the process, the result should return a single
        columnar value, the sysApplMapInstallPkgIndex, with the
        sysApplElmtRunIndex, sysApplRunIndex, and
        sysApplInstallElmtIndex contained in the instance identifier
        for the returned MIB object value.
        
        NOTE: if the process can not be associated back to an
        invoked application installed on the system, then the
        value returned for the columnar value
        sysApplMapInstallPkgIndex will be '0' and the instance
        portion of the object-identifier will be the process ID
        number (sysApplElmtRunIndex) followed by 0.0."
