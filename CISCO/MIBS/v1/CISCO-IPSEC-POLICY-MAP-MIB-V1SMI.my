--    The MIB module maps the IPSec
--    entities created dynamically to the policy entities
--    that caused them. This is an appendix to the
--    IPSEC-MONITOR-MIB that has been proposed to
--    IETF for monitoring IPSec based Virtual Private 
--    Networks.
--    
--    Overview of Cisco IPsec Policy Map MIB
--    
--    MIB description
--    
--    There are two components to this MIB:  
--    #1 a table that maps an IPSec Phase-1 
--    tunnel to the Internet Security Association 
--    and Key Exchange (ISAKMP) Policy 
--    
--    and 
--    
--    #2 a table that maps an IPSec Phase-2 
--    tunnel to the corresponding IPSec Policy
--    element - called 'cryptomaps' - in IOS 
--    (Internet Operating System)
--    
--    The first mappin (also called Internet Key Exchange
--    or IKE mapping) yields, given the index of
--    the IKE tunnel in the ikeTunnelTable
--    (IPSEC-MONITOR-MIB), the ISAKMP policy definition
--    defined using the CLI on the managed entity.
--    
--    The IPSec mapping yields, given the index
--    of the IPSec tunnel in the ipSecTunnelTable
--    (IPSEC-MONITOR-MIB), the IPSec transform and
--    the cryptomap definition that gave rise to
--    this tunnel.
--    
--    In implementation and usage, this MIB cannot
--    exist independent of the IPSEC-MONITOR-MIB.

ipSecPolMapAclString OBJECT-TYPE
    SYNTAX DisplayString

    DESCRIPTION
        "The value of this object is the number or
        the name of the access control string (ACL) 
        that caused this IPSec tunnel to be established. 
        The ACL that causes an IPSec tunnel
        to be established is referenced by the 
        cryptomap of the tunnel.
        
        The ACL identifies the traffic that requires
        protection as defined by the policy.
        
        For instance, the ACL that requires FTP
        traffic between local subnet 172.16.14.0 and a
        remote subnet 172.16.16.0 to be protected
        is defined as
        
         ==>access-list 101 permit tcp 172.16.14.0 0.0.0.255
                          172.16.16.0 0.0.0.255 eq ftp
        
         When this command causes an IPSec tunnel to be
        established, the object 'ipSecPolMapAclString'
        assumes the string value '101'.
        
         If the ACL is a named list such as
        ==> ip access-list standard myAcl
        permit 172.16.16.8 0.0.0.0
        
         then the value of this MIB element corresponding to 
        IPSec tunnel that was created by this ACL would
        be 'myAcl'."

ipSecPolMapAceString OBJECT-TYPE
    SYNTAX DisplayString
--    Rsyntax OCTET STRING(SIZE(0..255))
    ACCESS read-only
    STATUS mandatory
    DESCRIPTION
        "The value of this object is the access control 
        entry (ACE) within the ACL that caused this IPSec 
        tunnel to be established. 
        
        For instance, if an ACL defines access for two
        traffic streams (FTP and SNMP) as follows:
        
         access-list 101 permit tcp 172.16.14.0 0.0.0.255
                          172.16.16.0 0.0.0.255 eq ftp
         access-list 101 permit udp 172.16.14.0 0.0.0.255
                          host 172.16.16.1 eq 161
        
        
        When associated with an IPSec policy, the second
        element of the ACL gives rise to an IPSec tunnel
        in the wake of SNMP traffic. The value of the
        object 'ipSecPolMapAceString' for the IPSec tunnel
        would be then the string
         'access-list 101 permit udp 172.16.14.0 0.0.0.255
                          host 172.16.16.1 eq 161'"
