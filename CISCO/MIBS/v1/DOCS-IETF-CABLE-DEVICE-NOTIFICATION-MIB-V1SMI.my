--    The Event Notification MIB is an extension of the
--    CABLE DEVICE MIB.  It defines various notification
--    objects for both cable modem and cable modem termination
--    systems.  Two groups of SNMP notification objects are
--    defined.  One group is for notifying cable modem events,
--    and one group is for notifying cable modem termination
--    system events.
--    
--    DOCSIS defines numerous events, and each event is
--    assigned to a functional category.  This MIB defines
--    a notification object for each functional category.
--    The varbinding list of each notification includes
--    information about the event that occurred on the
--    device.
--    
--    Copyright (C) The Internet Society (2006).  This version
--    of this MIB module is part of RFC 4547; see the RFC
--    itself for full legal notices.
