               is initially empty at agent startup.  The agent
               creates a row in the table each time a condition is
               detected and deletes that row when that condition no
               longer pertains.  The agent creates the first row with
               upsAlarmId equal to 1, and increments the value of
               upsAlarmId each time a new row is created, wrapping to
               the first free value greater than or equal to 1 when
               the maximum value of upsAlarmId would otherwise be
               exceeded.  Consequently, after multiple operations,
               the table may become sparse, e.g., containing entries
               for rows 95, 100, 101, and 203 and the entries should
               not be assumed to be in chronological order because
               upsAlarmId might have wrapped.

               Alarms are named by an AutonomousType (OBJECT
               IDENTIFIER), upsAlarmDescr, to allow a single table to
               reflect well known alarms plus alarms defined by a
               particular implementation, i.e., as documented in the
               private enterprise MIB definition for the device.  No
               two rows will have the same value of upsAlarmDescr,
               since alarms define conditions.  In order to meet this
               requirement, care should be taken in the definition of
               alarm conditions to insure that a system cannot enter
               the same condition multiple times simultaneously.

               The number of rows in the table at any given time is
               reflected by the value of upsAlarmsPresent."
